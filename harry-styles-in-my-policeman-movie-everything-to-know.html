I look at them and think, ‘How did you get that? How do you get so that life is easy?’ But he has got a lovely, lovely character. It’s a <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a>.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Olivia Wilde</strong></a>, who is now dating the “Fine Line” singer, also <a href=#>praised his acting skills after working with him</a> on Don’t Worry Darling, which she directed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Little known fact: most male actors don’t want to play supporting roles in female-led films,” she wrote in February, after filming for the movie wrapped. “Enter: @harrystyles, our ‘Jack.’ Not only did he relish the opportunity to allow for the brilliant @florencepugh to hold center stage as our ‘Alice,’ but he infused every scene with a nuanced sense of humanity. He didn’t have to join our circus, but he jumped on board with humility and grace, and blew us away every day with his talent, warmth, and ability to drive backwards.”</p><p>Based on these glowing reviews, <a href=#>the Grammy winner seems poised to make another splash</a> in My Policeman.
