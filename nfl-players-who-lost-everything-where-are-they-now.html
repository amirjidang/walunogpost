I think players are beginning to be smart with their cash, but many do not manage their profits correctly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Why do some players blow their earnings, and some are smart with it? Some think it is on the basis of education, but simply put, the players weren't taught better, or did not listen to people who suggested them otherwise. Maybe the players didn't even have someone to consult with or manage their money. Either way, they lost everything at some point or another.</p><p>Even the players who made the biggest fortunes, somehow or another, end up broke. Most players live reckless lifestyles, and at some point, a realization has to kick in</p><p>Here are the Top 20 NFL players who went from the top to the bottom.</p><h2 id=vince-young><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Vince Young</span></h2><p>In January of 2014, Young filed for bankruptcy in a Houston federal bankruptcy court. Following his losses, Young landed a job at his alma mater at the University of Texas. On January 25, 2016, Young was charged with a DWI in Austin, Texas. On February 5, 2019, he was arrested for another DWI in Fort Bend County, Texas. He got out on bail both times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Young did in fact go back to the University of Texas for a degree in 2013. Vince works in various community service outlets but was terminated from being a Longhorns QB coach in 2019. Ouch.</p><h2 id=dermontti-dawson><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Dermontti Dawson</span></h2><p>Dawson was a center for the Pittsburgh Steelers for a little over a decade. He showed incredible loyalty to the Steelers, as he opted to retire after the team released him in 2000, rather than throw on&nbsp;another uniform.</p><p>The Hall of Famer filed for Bankruptcy in 2010, at the time he was around $69 million in debt. After retirement, he became a realtor.&nbsp;Today he lives in San Diego, as a sales executive for a promo products company. He has two children and is married. Since retirement, he and his wife have also established a scholarship in his name at the University of Kentucky, his alma mater.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=deuce-mcallister><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Deuce McAllister</span></h2><p>The Super Bowl XLIV champion, struggled a lot upon retirement.&nbsp;Although he owned a Nissan dealership, McAllister filed for bankruptcy a couple of years ago.

In 2018, the Saints hired him to be an analyst for WWL Radio.</p><h2 id=chris-mcalister><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Chris McAlister</span></h2><p class=organic>Coincidentally, two people with the last name McAlister are on this list. They are not related but have similar stories. After being married for three months, the former Raven got divorced and got in trouble for claiming that he couldn't pay his child support of only $3,000. He made around $45 million as a professional football player, and that lack of payment is unacceptable.</p><p class=organic>Today?</p><p class=organic>Chris McAlister coaches at various Baltimore Ravens outreach and community service events. He interned for the Buffalo Bills in 2016 but was not resigned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=raghab-ismail><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Raghab Ismail</span></h2><p class=organic>Rocket Ismail made football history when he chose the CFL over the NFL, signing a four year deal with the Toronto Argonauts for $18.2 million.&nbsp;The famous receiver made a lot of money in his football career but sadly made poor investments after retirement. Some of that money went to plastic surgery which saw the "Rocket" spent thousands of dollars on his face. Additionally failed business ventures like his own Hard Rock Cafe, led to Ismail's eventual financial meltdown.</p><p class=organic>Today, Ismail speaks at churches and is also talks at events as an inspirational speaker, often featured as a prominent Christian. He has done other small jobs like starring in ESPN satire TV shows.</p><h2 id=luther-ellis><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Luther Ellis</span></h2><p>Ellis filed for bankruptcy at the age of 36 years old. The two-time Pro Bowler earned over $11.6 million but managed to blow it with bad investments, and just bad spending habits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, Ellis is a defensive line coach for the Idaho Vandals football team. He has 12 children and his son Kaden was drafted by the Saints in 2019.</p><h2 id=archie-griffin><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Archie Griffin</span></h2><p class="ad-zone-container ad-zone-container-content-native-in-content">One of the greatest college football players ever, Archie Griffin, is on this list. He is the only college football player to win the Heisman Trophy twice.</p><p class="ad-zone-container ad-zone-container-content-native-in-content">The former two-time Heisman winner filed for bankruptcy because of his failed ventures in the&nbsp;sneaker business. After struggling to get back on his feet, he made big steps in his life. Griffin became the Ohio State Assistant Alumni Association Director.</p><h2 id=tiki-barber><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Tiki Barber</span></h2><p>Barber had a tough time adjusting to life after football, like many players who retire too soon. He started working for NBC as a broadcaster, but eventually, the job didn't pan out for him.&nbsp;After his uneventful stint at NBC, Barber decided to leave his wife, for an intern at his work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, Barber tried to come out of retirement, reportedly because he had trouble paying his divorce settlement. In 2014, he ran a marathon for C.C. Sabathia's foundation, which showed that he still had some speed in his legs.</p><h2 id=warren-sapp><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Warren Sapp</span></h2><p>Sapp has made many poor decisions in the last few years and those mistakes have left him a mess. The guy has thousands of shoes in his closet, actually around 2,400 pairs, as he is a sneaker-head. Due to his habits, the former Pro Bowler is over $6.7 million in debt. To add insult to injury, in 2015 he was arrested for hiring a prostitute, and fired by the NFL Network soon after.</p><p>Today, Warren is a grillmaster and has competed in barbecue challenges on television.</p><h2 id=andre-rison><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Andre Rison</span></h2><p>Andre Rison seemed to have it made in the NFL, receiving a big contract early in his career. He signed a $17 million contract with the Browns back in the 90s.</p><p>Following his retirement, Rison made a lot of poor financial decisions. In 2007, he filed for bankruptcy, and couldn't afford to pay child support. In the year 2012, he got five-year probation for once again not paying child support.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, Andre coaches High School football and trains receivers for private lessons.</p><h2 id=mark-brunell><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mark Brunell</span></h2><p>Brunell&nbsp;filed for bankruptcy in 2010 and was $25 million in debt in the end. during his playing days, he opened up fast-food chains, which didn't help his economic situation.</p><p>Today he volunteers at Florida colleges and coaches at a high school in Florida.

He frequently partied in vegas during his career and was released after three disastrous seasons.</p><p>Leaf has encountered many legal troubles since retirement. He was sentenced to five years in prison, stemming from earlier charges of burglary, theft and drug charges. On September 9, 2014, Leaf was sentenced to five years in prison.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lawrence-taylor><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lawrence Taylor</span></h2><p>The Hall of Fame member struggled with money upon retirement. "LT" lived a lavish lifestyle that eventually led to bankruptcy, and foreclosure of his home. He has had many drug-related offenses recently, and many domestic allegations from women.</p><p>LT does not have a job but is keeping it on the down-low. He has not gotten in trouble with the law since 2012 when he was accused of having sex with a 16-year-old.</p><h2 id=bernie-kosar><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Bernie Kosar</span></h2><p>The NFL star quarterback made $19 million in his career, mostly due to his stint as the star of the Cleveland Browns.</p><p>By 2009, he had only $44 in his checking account.

He is in and out of a CTE treatment program.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travis-henry><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Travis Henry</span></h2><p>Do you know why he went broke?

Although it was very cool, and interesting to see Tupac back, it was expensive for Marino. He bought $1,575,525 worth of shares of this company. Little did Dan know this company would never do something like this ever again, as Digital Domain filed for bankruptcy right after his purchase. Marino lost nearly $14 million.</p><p>Today, Marino does interviews with ESPN and opened up a foundation for autism. He sometimes appears on TV to do commercials or announcing. The Dolphins have since taken him back to do some work in their front office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=terrell-owens><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Terrell Owens</span></h2><p>After football (and bankruptcy) Owens took on the IRS and lost $400,000, okay no big deal, he's a millionaire. But by 2011, he was dead broke and made really dumb investments. In court, he told the judge he was struggling, he received no mercy from the court.</p><p>Today Owens takes every opportunity that he can to make money, being featured in modeling advertisements, reality shows, and starting his own podcast.</p><h2 id=michael-vick><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Michael Vick</span></h2><p>In 2007, he was arrested for running a dogfighting ring.

He thinks he deserves another crack at fame.</p><h2 id=ray-rice><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ray Rice</span></h2><p>Ray Rice was liked by the NFL, and fans in general for a good amount of time. Until the video surfaced. The video showed Ray Rice beating up his girlfriend in an elevator. In an instant, Rice became automatically hated by all of the NFL, and the world, after this one stupid move. I'm sure it wasn't the only time though that he was rash towards her. Rice lost millions of dollars and was sued by the Ravens.</p><p>In 2018, he spoke out on TMZ and Good Morning America about the incident. His life will never be the same after we witnessed his violent abusiveness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiln6RdpbmixcSrqmavmKR6rbvSrWSerpWnxrW0yKeeZq%2BYmr%2BmecCrnGasmJrGbrrOsGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1274011-the-rock-tells-elmo-hes-coming-to-sesame-street-to-kick-ass-and-eat-cookies.html><span>←</span><span>The Rock Tells Elmo Hes Coming To Sesame Street To Kick Ass And Eat Cookies</span></a>
