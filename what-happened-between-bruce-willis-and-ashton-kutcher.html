With the ongoing friendship of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, it's no surprise that the actor might have reacted negatively when Moore made peace with Kutcher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bruce-willis-beautiful-friendship-with-demi-moore>Bruce Willis' Beautiful Friendship With Demi Moore</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar41820907.jpg><p>When<a href=#> Demi Moore and Bruce Willis</a> broke up, they cited irreconcilable differences as the reason. It was reported that the primary reason for their split was because Willis wanted Moore to be a stay at home mom while she was at the height of her career.</p><p>Since Demi Moore wasn't willing to give up her acting career, their marriage would eventually lead to divorce. The two share three kids Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah, who are now great friends and enjoys a blended family together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Bruce Willis And Demi Moore's Nanny Claims 'She Was Denied A Social Life' While Working For The Couple">Bruce Willis And Demi Moore's Nanny Claims 'She Was Denied A Social Life' While Working For The Couple</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite their split, Willis admitted that he still loves Demi Moore. During his Rolling Stone interview, he said, “I still love Demi. We’re very close. We have three children whom we will continue to raise together, and we’re probably as close now as we ever were. We realize we have a lifelong commitment to our kids. "</p><p>Their relationship is now motivated by the friendship they made while co-parenting their three kids. The actor continued, "Our friendship continues. The institution has been set aside … It’s difficult to live your life and marriage under a magnifying glass, which is what happens to movie star couples.”</p><h2 id=bruce-willis-was-apparently-furious-that-demi-moore-made-peace-with-ashton-kutcher>Bruce Willis Was Apparently Furious That Demi Moore Made Peace With Ashton Kutcher</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bruce Willis was apparently bothered that Demi Moore is in good terms again with Ashton Kutcher. Bruce Willis and Demi Moore were married for 12 years before they decided to split up in 2000. Demi Moore went on to marry Ashton Kutcher in 2005, they got divorced in 2013. Bruce Willis on the other hand, had married model Emma Heming Willis in 2009.</p><p>An insider to Ok Magazine revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Willis is now happy with the way things are</a> and he apparently, "doesn’t want to see Ashton back in the mix”. The source further continued “Bruce doesn’t get why she’s willing to play nice when Ashton’s done nothing but humiliate her.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="What Are Bruce Willis And Demi Moore's Family Up To In 2021?

The <a href=#>actress even began dating again</a> after seven years of enjoying a single life. The source spilled, "Demi’s finally at the point where she doesn’t feel like she has to live up to anyone else’s expectations. She’s feeling really good about herself and is ready to put herself out there again."</p><h2 id=bruce-willis-was-upset-that-his-daughters-stayed-in-touch-with-ashton-kutcher>Bruce Willis Was Upset That His Daughters Stayed In Touch With Ashton Kutcher</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar49178574.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Willis was also furious that his children stayed in touch with Kutcher. <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore</a> reportedly got in touch again after Moore went to film an ad with Kutcher's wife, Mila Kunis. Despite Moore and Kutcher's divorce, the Die Hard star's daughters have continued their connection to the No Strings Attached actor.</p><p>This upset Willis even more as the source even claims, “Bruce isn’t thrilled that the girls still talk to the guy and that they gave their stamp of approval to Demi doing the ad with Mila. But Ashton was a dream stepdad to them, and that only aggravates him even more.”</p><p>Ashton Kutcher is <a href=#>close with Demi Moore's daughters</a>, and they created a strong bond with each other. During Ashton Kutcher's guest appearence on Marc Maron’s podcast, he said, “I make a really conscious effort to stay in touch with the girls. I love them, and I’m never going to stop loving them, right? And respecting them and honoring them and rooting for them to be successful in whatever they’re pursuing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmmqKqsKZ51qKjpaGjYq6vsIyaqqGsn6N6rMHTnJ%2Beql8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-did-charles-slacks-do-army-veteran-charged-over-domestic-shooting-603978-html.html><span>←</span><span>What did Charles Slacks do?
