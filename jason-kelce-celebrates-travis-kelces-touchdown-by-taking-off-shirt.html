After dropping the ball on the ground to signal his completion, Jason high-fived the cheering crowd.</p><p>“Jason Kelce having some fun in Buffalo,” video posted via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> by NFL on CBS read, alongside the caption, “A man of the people.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kelce-Brothers.jpg><p>The Chiefs traveled to Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, to take on the Bills for the second time this season. (The Bills were victorious over the Chiefs 20-17 in December 2023.)</p><p>Jason, who has been with the Eagles for 13 years, previously hinted that he’d be cheering on his brother. (The Eagles were defeated by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 32-9 in a wild card game earlier this month, which led them to be out of the running for the Super Bowl.)</p><p>“I don’t know, that’s one of the beautiful things about the offseason, it’s unscheduled,” Jason told reporters on Wednesday, January 17. “So, you know, obviously my brother’s still in the playoffs. I don’t get to watch him play very often, maybe I’ll get an opportunity to go watch one of those games this week.”</p><p>Jason wasn’t the only one in the Chiefs tight end’s corner on Sunday. Swift, 34, was <a href=#>spotted watching the game</a> alongside Jason and his wife, <strong>Kylie Kelce</strong>, as well as the brother’s parents, <strong>Ed Kelce</strong> and <strong>Donna Kelce</strong>.</p><p>While Swift has attended numerous games since being linked to Travis last summer, this interaction marked the first time that the singer was <a href=#>publicly seen with Jason</a> and Kylie, 31. Swifties have been highly anticipating Swift’s meet-up with Travis’ sister-in-law and were excited to see the twosome <a href=#>chatting inside a suite</a>.</p><p>Fans were hoping to see Swift connect with Kylie in October 2023 when the Eagles played the New York Jets in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which is located near Swift’s New York City home. Much to their dismay, Travis attended the game solo.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ed confirmed later that month that the “Karma” singer hadn’t met Kylie, Jason, and their three daughters, Wyatt, 4, Elliotte, 2, and Bennett, 10 months.</p><p>“They’ll flip [over meeting her],” Ed told Entertainment Tonight of his granddaughters. “No doubt.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGaq5%2Bjeqyxy5ycZpuVobKjvsCtnKxlpKeut7XSZqKepJOawG7Azq6aoZyfrLturthmq5qjmaO0brvFn2SsoJmnwXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jackie-miller-why-did-ohio-school-bus-driver-resign-664600-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jackie Miller | Why Did Ohio School Bus Driver Resign</span></a>
