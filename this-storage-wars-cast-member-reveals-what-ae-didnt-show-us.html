We'll discuss that, along with <a href=#>Brandi Passante's recent revealing interview</a>, as she discussed what the show doesn't decide to air. We're seeing some of the best storage units but that doesn't mean we're seeing all of them.</p><h2 id=claims-have-been-made-of-the-show-being-fake>Claims Have Been Made Of The Show Being Fake</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As much as fans love 'Storage Wars', there has been controversy attached to the program, especially when it comes to the validity of storage lockers.</p><p>Way back in 2012, Dave Hester made a lot of noise, <a href=#>claiming that the show was fake.</a> According to the reality star, the program had an agreement with 'Off The Wall Antiques' which would supply them with rare items that would be planted in the lockers.</p><p>In his court statement, Hester revealed that tampering would take place, "The truth is that Defendants regularly salt or plant the storage lockers that are the subject of the auctions portrayed on the Series with valuable or unusual items to create drama and suspense for the show. Defendants have even gone so far as to stage entire storage units, and will enlist the cooperation of the owners of the storage facilities to stage entire units."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>15 Things About Storage Wars We Don't Understand</a></span></p><p>Alongside Business Insider, Hester would also claim that bids would be made when auctions weren't even running just for show purposes, ''While on location filming an auction, Defendants (A&E) also film footage of the cast members and the public bidding when no actual auction is taking place in order to make it appear that any of the cast members are bidding at any given auction, whether or not he or she is actually bidding on the unit."</p><p>We're not entirely sure whether or not that was the truth. What we do know, is that Brandi revealed alongside Distractify that not all units are shown on the air.</p><h2 id=the-network-omits-certain-units>The Network Omits Certain Units</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alongside Distractify, Brandi Passante discussed some elements of the show that are lesser-known. Unlike Dave's past comments, she revealed that the show is in fact real and that tampering with units is against the law.</p><p>However, she did admit that certain elements of the show are not shown. Sure, we see the best of the best units, however during the course of the day, <a href=#>several units are purchased and not all of them make it onto the show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>''You're going to get good ones and bad ones, and I don't think the show really highlights the bad ones as much ... but it definitely happens," Brandi said. "From the very beginning, I think when people saw the show, they just assumed that this was some kind of get-rich-quick, modern-day treasure hunt and in every unit, you're going to find something great — but that's just not how it goes. You just have to try your best to make a guesstimate as to what's going to be in there."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>15 Things The Storage Wars Cast Has Said About The Show</a></span></p><p>Brandi revealed that signs of a good unit are those that are well put together. If the unit seems to be out of place and just thrown everywhere, chances are, the owner didn't care for whatever is in there and therefore, the buyers shouldn't care either.</p><h2 id=the-show-continues-on>The Show Continues On</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reality show started way back in 2010 and over a decade later, it remains on the air, currently in its 13th season. Extra hype was recently added, as the show is promoting the long-awaited return of Barry Weiss, who was on the sidelines due to a terrible accident.</p><p>It has had its ups and downs but clearly, fans are still watching, despite all the gossip that the network was forced to put up with in the past.</p><p>Surely, the first seasons will always stand out among the top, though it is still great to see that the show is ongoing with no real ending point set to take place or announced by A&E.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Storage Wars: 20 Junky Items That Turned Out To Be Worth A Fortune</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYsC1u9Ganp5lp5a%2FtHnCmqqtZZ2auqOx0Wapnq6Vlrm0edahmK1lkZp6pbXDp6tmq5ikxG7B0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stars-who-love-video-games.html><span>←</span><span>These Stars Love Their Video Games And Don't Care Who Knows It</span></a>
