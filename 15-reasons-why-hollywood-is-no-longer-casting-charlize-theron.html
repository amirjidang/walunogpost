Or at least, that’s what we used to think about her. These days it seems like Charlize isn’t the leading lady that she used to be during the early days of her career. As a matter of fact, we seem to be seeing less and less of her on the big screen, which is making many people wonder&nbsp;what is going on with Charlize Theron’s career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, don’t get us wrong here: Charlize still does act. She hasn't quit the industry the same way Cameron Diaz has. Instead, she just not in the same blockbuster movies that she used to be in. What’s more, it almost seems like she’s downgraded herself by playing in movies like The Fate and the Furious. This of course, begs the question, "What did Charlize Theron do that has made Hollywood producers to stop calling her? Is she difficult to work with? Did she throw some behind the scenes tantrums that we don’t know about? Or is she just picky about her projects?" That’s what her fans want to know! With that being said, we’ve got 15 reasons why Hollywood is no longer casting Charlize Theron. It looks like Charlize's time as an A-lister has come to an end for good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-one-is-taking-her-phone-calls-anymore><strong>No One Is Taking Her Phone Calls Anymore</strong></h2><p>You would think that someone like <a href=#>Charlize Theron</a> would be able to pick and choose the projects she would want to be in at this stage in her career. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Even though she used to star in huge movies like Monster and North Country, producers aren’t taking her phone calls anymore. Now, we don’t want to say that she’s past her expiration date. But she’s not fresh goods either, so to speak. It’s been several years since Charlize Theron has even had a hit!</p><p>Charlize once said, “And I do think that earlier in my career, I did make a very conscious decision to make sure that I was doing work that wasn't necessarily given to me, and that people didn't necessarily think that I would be able to do it.”</p><h2 id=she-s-not-a-box-office-draw><strong>She’s Not&nbsp;A Box Office Draw</strong></h2><p>Let’s face it: the entertainment industry is one the most cut-throat businesses out there. One day you are the it girl, the next day no one wants you anymore. It’s evil, it’s vicious, and it’s definitely not for the weak. Yet, for some reason everyone wants to be a part of it. And as far as Charlize Theron is concerned, she just not the box office draw that she used to be. She’s also not bringing in the same kind of ticket sales that she used to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlize said in the past, “So how critics will perceive your film or your work, or whether your movie is going to make $100 million at the box office, or whether you are going to be winning any awards&nbsp;– well, you have no control over that.”</p><h2 id=she-has-a-bad-reputation><strong>She Has A Bad Reputation</strong></h2><p>According to a lot of people who have worked with her behind the scenes, Charlize Theron isn’t the nicest person in Hollywood. In fact, you can find more people who will have something bad to say about her than good. Simply put, Charlize is not the kind of person who is looking to be your friend. Just ask <a href=#>Tia Mowry</a>. A few years back there were reports that said Charlize tried to get Tia booted from her SoulCycle class. Let’s just say that words were exchanged and that they were not pretty.</p><p>Charlize once put it this way, “You can never get to a place of comfort in this business. As soon as you hit that little cushy spot, somebody's gonna kick you out. So I have a constant need to do it better.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-knows-she-has-issues><strong>She Knows She Has Issues</strong></h2><p>Now, no one knows what kind of person Charlize Theron is behind closed doors. She’s an actress and she’ll choose what she wants to show to the outside world. But Charlize has made it no secret that she does have her issues. She didn’t have an easy childhood and she certainly didn’t have an easy time making her mark on Hollywood. Now, we don’t want to start labeling her here. But there’s a certain attitude and persona that Charlize does carry with her everywhere she goes, if you what we mean. Hint, hint: she's not very nice.</p><p>Charlize has said, “When I'm working I don't have room to think about myself and my own issues. It's really freeing. There is no room for me, which is really nice.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-thinks-she-s-too-beautiful><strong>She Thinks She’s Too Beautiful</strong></h2><p>There are a few people in this world that would say Charlize Theron isn’t a beautiful woman. I mean, let’s face it: the woman is drop dead gorgeous, has legs for days and is one of the most beautiful blonde women you’ll ever meet. She’s one of a kind. But at the same time, all of the attention that Charlize gets must have gotten to her head. That’s because she thinks one of the reasons why she doesn’t get roles is because she’s too beautiful. Okay, there.</p><p>Charlize said in an interview, “I was victim to that very early in my career, where I would go into auditions, and I'd be wearing a big T-shirt, a big baggy t-shirt and loose jeans. You know, to try and show people that there was more to me than just that.”</p><h2 id=she-s-picky-with-who-she-wants-to-work-with><strong>She’s Picky With Who She Wants To Work With</strong></h2><p>Sure, Charlize Theron has friends in the entertainment business. We’ve seen her getting up close and personal with pals at Hollywood parties. She also has a certain taste in men (how could we ever forget her interesting yet very bizarre romance with Sean Penn?). But with that being said, you can also count all of her friends on one hand. That’s just how “friendly” she is. She’s also very picky when it comes to the people she wants to work with in the entertainment industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlize has said, “I guess there are very few actors that I've worked with that I would like to work with again. You never think you'll have that chance and, if we didn't do Italian Job together, there wouldn't be another one that could be right.”</p><h2 id=she-has-a-hard-time-staying-grounded><strong>She Has A Hard Time Staying Grounded</strong></h2><p>When it comes to Hollywood, it’s without a doubt that a lot of people have a hard time staying grounded. I mean, let’s face it: these people make ten times more than the average salary in the United States. They also have access to all the most luxurious things in the world. And with Charlize, it’s no different. Let’s just say that she might think that she’s too big for her britches. I mean, it’s not like any of us out there would look back at her catalog of films and call it “Charlize Theron movies,” right? Well, Charlize wants us to think that she sees it the same way. But really, she doesn’t. Uh-huh girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlize said in the past, “I guess because I pay so much attention to the physical part of the character, I don't look upon it as like Charlize Theron up there. I don't think of them as like Charlize Theron films.”</p><h2 id=she-might-not-want-to-act-anymore><strong>She Might Not Want To Act Anymore</strong></h2><p>When it comes to the movie industry, we’ve seen a lot of stars come and go. There are very few people out there that actually make it the distance. And at this point, it’s safe to say that Charlize Theron is one of those actresses that has seen her star fade in recent years. That might be the reason why she’s looking to switch gears. Apparently, she doesn’t want to work that much in front of the cameras anymore.</p><p>Charlize said, “I mean, I'm new but I've always been very interested in film making process and I've been lucky enough to work with film makers in my past that have been very encouraging to let me hang around. I get so emotionally vested - that the producer part of me was natural.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-focusing-more-on-family><strong>She’s Focusing More On Family</strong></h2><p>Also, Charlize has made it no secret that she has different priorities in her life right now. With two small children at home, she’s focusing on her family. And that’s not a bad thing. After all, she has the money in the bank that would allow her to afford a pretty comfortable lifestyle without having to work another day in her life. She has also said that she wants to spend more time at home with her kids. And who can blame her?</p><p>Charlize said, “I want my son to grow up with a mom that he could see and look at her life with all the mistakes and with all the failures and all the flaws and say, ‘My mom lived an authentic life. That was the life she wanted to live.’"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hollywood-criticism><strong>Hollywood Criticism</strong></h2><p>One of the toughest parts about being a Hollywood star is all of the nasty things that are often said about you in the press and online. Charlize has just as many critics as she does fans. One person might love her in a certain movie while others will absolutely hate it. At this point, Charlize understands that you can’t make everyone happy. That’s why she’s decided to blow them off and live her best life, regardless of what others may think about it. She’s got her Academy Award. She’s got her success. She’s got her career and her family. Nothing else matters to her.</p><p>Charlize said, “I don't believe in charmed lives. I think that tragedy is part of the lesson you learn to lift yourself up, to pick yourself up and to move on.”</p><h2 id=she-falls-victim-to-self-pity><strong>She Falls Victim To Self-Pity</strong></h2><p>But then again, Charlize is one person who knows how to work an audience. She knows that being this self-confident actress with model-blessed genes is not going to cut it with everyone. That’s why she sometimes turns on the self-pity machine from time to time. She wants to remind everyone that she didn’t have the best childhood (her mother&nbsp;attacked her father out of self-defence when she was a teen!) and that no one gave her a helping hand when she first started out in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Charlize likes to put it, “I was raised with the idea that you can feel sorry for yourself, but then, get over it, because it doesn't get you anywhere. There was always this awareness that you have to be responsible for yourself in order to have what you want.”</p><h2 id=her-ocd-problems><strong>Her OCD Problems</strong></h2><p>At the same time, though, Charlize does admit that she isn’t perfect. But then again, who is? She does have certain issues that she struggles with, which might make it very hard for other actors and actresses to work with her. It’s a complicated matter, but one that Charlize has been trying to control in recent years. But as a lot of people know, the harder you get, the harder it is to get the help you need or control your own impulses. Charlize knows this.</p><p>Also, for Charlize, she needs to have things done a certain way before she can even start working. She once said, “I have OCD, which is not fun. I have to be incredibly tidy and organized or it messes with my mind and switches off on me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-personal-life-is-messy-too><strong>Her Personal Life Is Messy Too</strong></h2><p>Charlize hasn’t been in a stable relationship in a very long time. The last time she was with someone was <a href=#>Halle Berry</a>’s ex, Gabriel Aubry. Before then, she dated <a href=#>Sean Penn</a> in what can only be described as a rollercoaster relationship.</p><p>And apparently, Charlize is not looking to settle down with anyone, anytime soon. She has her kids to focus on and she doesn’t want to deal with the messiness that comes with getting married. She has said, “Right now the institution of marriage feels very one-sided, and I want to live in a country where we all have equal rights. I have so many friends who would so badly want to get married, that I wouldn't be able to sleep with myself [if I got married before they could].”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-she-difficult-to-work-with><strong>Is She Difficult To Work With?</strong></h2><p>Now, no one has ever flat-out said that Charlize Theron is a difficult superstar to work with. But she has had her feuds. She’s had a hard time working with <a href=#>Tom Hardy</a> and <a href=#>Tobey Maguire</a>. A lot of people have called her a ticking time bomb, so to speak. She has even said that “being gorgeous” hasn’t really helped her much in this regard, either. Charlize thinks that being beautiful has hampered her more than help her.</p><p>Also, add this to the list. Charlize has said, “I have a problem with cabinets being messy and people just shoving things in and closing the door. I will lie in bed and not be able to sleep because I'll say to myself: 'I think I saw something in that cabinet that just shouldn't be there.'”</p><h2 id=she-s-been-replaced-by-the-young-crowd><strong>She’s Been Replaced By The Young Crowd</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest reasons why Charlize Theron is no longer getting the same amount of work that she used to is because she’s been replaced by the younger crowd. There’s a new crop of twenty-something actresses that people are buying movie tickets to see these days. And honestly, Charlize sounds a little bitter about it, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlize said, “It's ironic that we've built the beauty world around 20-year-olds, when they have no concept about wisdom, what life is about, having a few relationships below [their] belt and feeling hardships, to grow into [their] skin and feel confident within [themselves] and to feel the value of who [they] are, not because of a man or because of something like that. And I think that's such a beautiful thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6s7HArKanq12stbp5x6ijpbGnpLylecisZKenXaG8r7PEq2ScmaOptq%2BzjJyfmqqcnsemedOhnKunnmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paris-hilton-black-wig-disguise-carter-christmas-shopping.html><span>←</span><span> Paris Hilton Has Terribly Flawed Disguise Shopping for Christmas Pres</span></a>
