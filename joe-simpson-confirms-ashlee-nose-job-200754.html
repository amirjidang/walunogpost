"You can't just put these kids out in the world and they're on their own. I can remember a time when Jessica was singing at Madison Square Garden and her outfit ripped before she went on. We were there for her."</p><p>And then there was Ashlee's Saturday Night Live debacle.</p><p>"She'd lost her voice, and Jordan Schur [then the head of her record label] insisted she lip-synch," he said. "She'd never done it before.&nbsp;She didn't want to do it. Anyway, she'll never do it again. We just did a huge tour, and there was no lip-synching."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former Baptist minister also denies claims that he's a controlling father. "I don't tell my girls who to date or marry or what to do."</p><p>He also has no hard feelings against former son-in-law <strong>Nick Lachey</strong>. "I have nothing against Nick," he told me. "But they got married very young. I told Jessica, 'You're going to hit an age when it's all going to be clear to you — life, that is — and you'll know what you want to do.'"&nbsp;Joe added: "I do blame 50 percent of their break-up on the media."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5ViwKq5z6ymp2WTpLuntdGmqmaZo525prGMp6asnV2fvKN5kWlncG1kZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-kelce-celebrates-travis-kelces-touchdown-by-taking-off-shirt.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Kelce Celebrates Travis Kelces Touchdown By Taking Off Shirt</span></a>
