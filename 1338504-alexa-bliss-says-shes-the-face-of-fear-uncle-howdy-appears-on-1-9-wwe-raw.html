In a long speech, Bliss said that Belair is hiding from her, and not because anyone is afraid of Bray Wyatt or Uncle Howdy. Instead, Bliss said, she is “the face of evil,” and that she hasn’t felt this good in a really, really long time. Bliss went on to say that she’s finally taken control of things and is now the one in charge, and would use her hands to tear a scar into Bianca’s face and take the WWE RAW Women’s Championship.</p><p>After her speech, a video popped up on the jumbotron, showing off a playground in black and white. Soon, though, Uncle Howdy’s face would appear alongside the sound of laughter. In the video, Uncle Howdy asked Bliss if she really feels like she’s in charge, before appearing on the ramp and laughing as Bliss watched on.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>“Do you believe you’re in charge?”</p><p>?
