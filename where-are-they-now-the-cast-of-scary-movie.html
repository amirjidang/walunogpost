Ever since the over-the-top horror movies of the 1970s, filmmakers have understood the absurdity of some of the things that are depicted on the silver screen. While parodies exist of all film genres, the parody of the horror movie strikes a unique chord with audiences. These parodies take what makes you clasp your hands over your face in the theatre and scream in terror and warps them into something that the audience can laugh at. In essence, it’s a way to laugh at your fears.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the massive popularity of the slasher genre hitting the 90s strong with the Scream series, the Wayans brothers saw an opportunity. They saw a genre that was ripe for some humor. With the immensely talented brothers working hard on a parody film, they decided to focus on Scream in particular.</p><p>With a release in 2000, Scary Movie immediately found an audience who understood what they were trying to do. The film made a healthy profit at the box office and launched the successful acting career of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Faris</a>. With a talented cast around her, the film would become a staple of parodies and the textbook in which to look for aspiring filmmakers. But, what happened to the cast?</p><p>Do they still act? Have they stepped behind the camera? Or, have they stepped away from the spotlight and the busy world of acting?</p><p>This list compiles the cast of Scary Movie and examines what they’ve been doing in the almost two decades since the film’s debut. Enjoy!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shannon-elizabeth><strong>Shannon Elizabeth</strong></h2><p>The darling of the early 2000s, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shannon Elizabeth</a> became massively popular. With her breakout role in American Pie, Elizabeth’s popularity skyrocketed. For a while, everyone wanted her in their movie. She was a guaranteed cash grab. However, as with most things, her fame proved to be a trend. As the years went on, her roles in popular movies became less and less. But, that doesn’t mean she has stopped acting.</p><p>In recent years, Shannon has starred in a number of small films. Some of the more noteworthy films since Scary Movie in 2000 include Night of the Demons and The Outsider. She’s also starred in a couple of television movies as well.</p><p>With a large number of stars from the 90s seeing a revitalization of their careers in 2016 and 2017, watch out for Elizabeth to make a comeback in the near future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=carmen-electra><strong>Carmen Electra</strong></h2><p>Yes, she was in Scary Movie! She’s in the beginning of the film and doesn’t last long, but she does make an appearance and is the perfect choice for a parody of female portrayals in horror movies. While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carmen</a> got her big break in the early 90s, her fame quickly reached a fever pitch over the course of about 10 years. Around the time Scary Movie came out, she was at that peak.</p><p>Since 2000, Electra has starred in a handful of films, but it seems as if her passion has shifted. Seeing as she’s taken roughly a role a year, these days finds Electra putting her talents in the musical world. She has released 4 singles since 2012. It seems as if she now juggles a musical and film career.</p><h2 id=cheri-oteri><strong>Cheri Oteri</strong></h2><p>You may remember <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oteri</a> from a host of projects she’s starred in since the 1990s. But, the most famous is probably her multiple roles on Saturday Night Live. Her SNL days saw her star in a slew of sketches that would be etched into the memories of viewers. After all, she was in arguably one of the best casts the sketch comedy show has ever seen. Her time with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Ferrell</a> as the Spartan cheerleaders is a classic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oteri starred as the reporter in Scary Movie and has since starred in a variety of roles. She’s a regular voice actor on the Disney television show Imagination Movers. She’s also starred in a few comedies in recent years, with roles in Grown Ups 2, Comedy Bang! Bang! and The Fairly OddParents.</p><h2 id=anna-faris><strong>Anna Faris</strong></h2><p>Out of all of the actors who appeared in Scary Movie, nobody has been catapulted into the spotlight like Anna Faris. Since the comedy, her career has skyrocketed. Much like the Wayans Brothers, she tends to do well in dramas as well as comedies. She appeared in Brokeback Mountain and Lost in Translation.</p><p>With a high-profile romance with another rising star, actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Pratt</a>, ending in divorce, this fact has done little to derail her career. One of the more notable things about Faris is her appearance. As her star has risen, she has become one of the prettiest actresses out there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She’s also dabbled in television as she stars in the sitcom Mom. She’s a multi-talented actress who has a ton of potential for even more great things in her future.</p><h2 id=regina-hall><strong>Regina Hall</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hall</a> is the perfect example of an actress who started in comedy and gradually made a name for herself as a multi-talented worker. Playing Brenda Meeks in the 2000 comedy, she also starred in a lot of the sequels that got made due to the popularity of the original.</p><p>Besides the sequels to the original, Hall has starred in a number of other comedies. In 2017, she starred in the hit comedy Girls Trip. She also starred in another parody movie. Along with Scary Movie, she starred in Superhero Movie in 2009.</p><p>While still starring in hit movies, she also became an ambassador for<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Elizabeth Taylor's&nbsp;</a>White Diamonds. She continues to do a lot in films and television and is still proving to everybody just how much of a talent she is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dave-sheridan><strong>Dave Sheridan</strong></h2><p>Scary Movie’s plot is a hilarious and sidesplitting take on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wes Craven’s</a> Scream films. Not only was the story parodied to a tee, but the characters were mirrors of their horror film counterparts. The dimwitted sheriff is no exception.</p><p>In the original Scream film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Arquette</a> portrayed Officer Dewey. Not one to pull any punches, Scary Movie had their own version of Dewey. Meet Deputy Doofy.</p><p>Seen as the most surprising character in the film (I won’t reveal it due to spoilers), Doofy was played by Dave Sheridan. Ever since then, Sheridan starred in a hefty amount of movies. Some of his more notable films include The Fighting Temptations, A Haunted House (also from the Wayans Brothers) and Fifty Shades of Black. Keeping busy, Sheridan continues making movies.</p><h2 id=marlon-wayans><strong>Marlon Wayans</strong></h2><p>The Wayans Brothers first got their start in comedy. While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Damon</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keenen-Ivory</a> stayed in the realm of comedy as their careers evolved, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marlon</a> took a role that would cement his legacy as a dramatic actor. Marlon played Tyrone C. Love in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Darren Aronofsky’s</a> classic Requiem for a Dream.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As well as drama, Marlon has proven he can take on an action picture as well. He starred in G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra in 2009. Along with these two films, he’s starred in a lot of his brothers’ projects, films such as A Haunted House (and its sequel), as well as the Scary Movie sequel and Fifty Shades of Black.</p><p>In August of 2017, Marlon will star in his own NBC comedy.</p><h2 id=jayne-trcka><strong>Jayne Trcka</strong></h2><p>Scary Movie has a plethora of interesting and, frankly, gross moments. But, fans of the movie will remember a particularly revealing scene with Anna Farris and Jayne Trcka. For those who may not know who Trcka is, she’s a female bodybuilder in real life. She’s appeared in a variety of fitness magazines and has competed in numerous competitions for bodybuilding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That description may have jogged your memory. But, if not, Trcka was involved in a scene where she was having a one-on-one conversation with Farris. Since Trcka looks rather manly, the joke of the scene came when she stood up. A set of two testicles dropped from her underwear. It was a moment that is hard to forget, and one of the funnier scenes from the film.</p><h2 id=kurt-fuller><strong>Kurt Fuller</strong></h2><p>Known for his comedic roles, Kurt Fuller has been around the acting game for some time. Beginning in 1987 with a role in one of the most iconic science fiction movies of all-time, his first time on screen was in The Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger. After that, his films filtered to the funnier side and he had racked up quite a few roles before his time in Scary Movie as the Senior Police Officer.</p><p>Since the smash hit of 2000, Fuller has continued his comedic streak. He had a recurring role as Woody Strode on the hit TV series Psych. He also starred in National Lampoon’s Van Wilder: Freshman Year in 2009 and even lent his voice to the 2011 video game L.A. Noire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems Kurt has been busy since Scary Movie.</p><h2 id=kelly-coffield-park><strong>Kelly Coffield Park</strong></h2><p>If you watched comedies on TV in the 90s, you may remember a little show that launched comedy stars into the mainstream and made them a house hold name. In Living Color had an amazing who’s who of stars. Comedy geniuses such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Carrey</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Allan Grier</a>, and the Wayans Brothers were all stars of this hilarious show.</p><p>Another member of this cast is the equally funny Kelly Coffield Park. Making a name for herself outside of the show, Coffield Park made appearances in a few television shows after her time with In Living Color, but hasn’t done much since. Scary Movie is the last major feature that Coffield Park appeared in and it seems that she is perfectly happy with her life.</p><h2 id=lochlyn-munro><strong>Lochlyn Munro</strong></h2><p>It’s not uncommon for movie stars to appear in multiple films a year. After all, it’s their job and it seems to pay pretty well. But, some of these stars of television and film go above and beyond. They are so busy it seems as if they never take a break. Such is the case with Lochlyn Munro.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He’s clocked in more than 200 roles between film and television. In Scary Movie, he played Greg Phillippe. He tends to play a cop more often than not, but this hasn’t stopped him from taking comedic roles as well.</p><p>Recently, Munro has been in The Age of Reason, Rampage: Capital Punishment, and 12 Rounds 3: Lockdown. He is still keeping busy and looks as if he has no intentions of stopping any time soon.</p><h2 id=jon-abrahams><strong>Jon Abrahams</strong></h2><p>Playing the role of Bobby Prinze in Scary Movie, Abrahams has a host of other films he can say he starred in. It’s interesting to note that Jon played a character in a parody of a horror movie, only to star in 2005’s House of Wax along with the likes of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Hilton</a>.</p><p>Since his time in the 2000 comedy, Abrahams has starred in a handful of television projects. He had a role on Criminal Minds and has starred in other projects such as Standing Still, Condemned, and Two for One.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although not too active in film, he does seem to take some roles every once in a while. Jon can rest assured that his performance in Scary Movie will cement his legacy as being in one of the funniest comedies of the 00s.</p><h2 id=keenen-ivory-wayans><strong>Keenen Ivory Wayans</strong></h2><p>Arguably one of the most successful of the Wayans Brothers, Keenan Ivory Wayans has seen a lot of his success behind the camera. He pulls double duty in Scary Movie (although it is just a brief cameo), as he both has a small role in the film as well as directing it. You might even see he did three times the normal work, as he also had a hand in writing the project.</p><p>He's directed and written almost as many movies as he’s been in. With films like Dance Flick and Scary Movie, Keenan both directed and appeared in it. Among his writing credits include I’m Gonna Git You Sucka, Little Man, and Scary Movie 2.</p><p>These days, Keenan Ivory Wayans is happy helping his brothers with their projects and lending his expertise to them when needed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-lander><strong>David Lander</strong></h2><p>This is one of the oldest members of the cast and maybe the most prestigious as well. Lander is most well-known from his work in the 1970s on a revolutionary show called Laverne and Shirley. Playing Squiggy in the 1970s masterpiece, he did go on to star in other things. However, the 1970s sitcom is what he’s best known for.</p><p>In the 2000 horror movie parody, he played Principal Squiggman (the pun is obvious). Most older audience members would have been able to pick him out and were probably quite surprised to see his face in the comedy flick.</p><p>These days, Lander lends his voice to cartoons. His credits in these mediums include Spongebob SquarePants and The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy.</p><h2 id=shawn-wayans><strong>Shawn Wayans</strong></h2><p>Along with the other Wayans brothers, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shawn</a> is also immensely talented. He’s a talented actor and also has a lot of artistic weapons at his disposal. He shares a lot of similarities with his brother Keenen in that he also likes to direct and write films. He’s directed and co-written a handful of films with his brother Keenen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, he has stepped out of the spotlight in recent years. One of his only credits in television in the 2010s happened in 2016 in the show Animals. Although he has stepped away from the limelight, that doesn’t mean he hasn’t been busy. He’s got some improv shows lined up in the near future.</p><p>If you’re looking for a talented actor and writer who can do comedy and drama, then Shawn Wayans is your guy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKCfmLiqusZorqGdopp6or7EZquhnaliu7DDjK2fnmWTlsC1ec6fZKybkafGbrnOr6CeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-vin-diesels-ethnicity-and-nationality-617415-html.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Vin Diesels Ethnicity and Nationality?</span></a>
