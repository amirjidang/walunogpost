It’s difficult but life is long and you can’t always play the short game.”</p><p>The author <a href=#>announced her departure</a> from the Bravo series on Wednesday, July 25. Her rep gave a statement to Us Weekly at the time: “After six seasons on Bravo’s RHONYC, I have decided to return to what I do best – journalism and producing. I am sure this does not come as a surprise to any of the viewers, all of whom have been supportive, encouraging, and kind. My original curiosity about reality television has waned over the years and I am focusing on TV and writing projects that better suit my more steady temperament. I have worked with amazing producers, made great friends, and I’m thrilled to leave frenemies behind. I will remember this entire experience with delight, humor, and a veracious accuracy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Carole-Radziwill-Values-Real-Housewives-of-New-York-Instagram-2.jpg><p>Radziwill — who joined RHONY in season 5 — had also been feuding with her costars.
