Following under his dad, Melvin Booker’s (a former basketball player himself) footsteps), Devin Booker travels a lot to different cities with his team the Phoenix Suns to go face off against other teams within the NBA league. He also went to Tokyo, Japan during the 2021 Summer Olympics to compete with the Team USA basketball team.

Kendall's tweet counted as a vote for Devin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering basketball runs in the family with both Devin’s Dad having played professional basketball before retiring in 2008 and now Devin himself, basketball is a big part of the family. Between Kendall’s constant love and support towards Devin and his basketball career to trying to help gain fan support to get him into the All-Star game, this must-have Kendall in his good books. After all, all parents, such as Devin Booker’s ever want is for their son is to be happy and to find success in what he does, as Devin notable has found happiness and success. Most of all, his parents would want him to be with someone who supports the sport he loves to play and not get in the way of it.

Kendall Jenner has also made time to go to <a href=#>Mississippi and meet Devin Booker’s family</a>, including his grandmother.
