I have an announcement to make: No, I'm not pregnant," she joked while on the panel.</p><p>She admitted at the time that executives were still coming up with ideas for the show, but things were definitely moving forward quickly and Symone couldn’t wait to start commencing production. She continued to explain the premise of the series, revealing: "There's no title yet, but I'm calling it That's So Raven 2.</p><p>“It's Raven Baxter. It's still me. But I am a mother this time. I'm going to be a single mother raising two kids, and one of them learns that she has visions.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after her departure, Adam Bonnett, VP of original programming for Disney Channel, said in a statement that the firm was excited to continue their partnership with Symone, who they say has been a tremendous force behind the network’s success.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Based On Your Zodiac Sign, Which Disney Channel Actor Are You?</a></span></p><p>“Raven’s brilliant style of fearless comedy was a driving force for Disney Channel’s success around the world. Her performance in That’s So Raven is timeless.</p><p>“We now have our eyes on the future with her, and we’re looking forward to telling more stories for a new generation with an adult Raven Baxter raising her young family.”</p><p>Raven’s Home ended up premiering in 2017 to stellar reviews and strong ratings, so it’s understandable why Disney has already awarded the show with three more seasons since its premiere three years ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October 2019, when the fourth season was given the green light, execs over at Disney once again had nothing but positive things to say about their relationship with Symone, adding that working with the latter certainly wasn’t going to end anytime soon.</p><p>“Raven is a huge part of the Disney Channel family and ‘Raven’s Home’ continues to serve our audience with the comedy, heart, and relatability that they want to see on TV,” said Kory Lunsford, vice president of Disney Channel’s current series gushed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 10 Biggest Disney Channel Stars Of The 2000s, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>“We have much more in store for the Baxter family and their household and can’t wait for new stories to unfold in season four.”</p><p>And while the 34-year-old has seen plenty of success with Raven’s Home, Symone has also been keeping herself busy working on other shows, such as her handful of guest appearances on the ever-so-popular sitcom Black-ish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, she also took part in FOX’s talent series The Masked Singer, before going on to star in Big City Greens where she voiced the character of Maria Media for four episodes.</p><p>Needless to say, Symone’s career is booming right now.</p><p>In April 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, the former Cosby Show actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reunited with her former Cheetah Girls co-star</a>, Kiely Williams, whom she hadn’t spoken to since their infamous feud, which erupted while filming the second installment of the franchise.</p><p>During a chat on Instagram Live, Symone is heard telling Williams: “The cliquish way that there was during that movie made me feel excluded from my original team.</p><p>“Not that it was strong, to begin with, but I felt excluded…we have other things that just led up to that moment that just were weird, personal outside of business.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unaware of how she had made Symone feel during the months they shot the flick, with the latter feeling secluded from her cast members, Wiliams was quick to chime in and express how apologetic she felt over the situation.</p><p>“I would never try to hurt you on purpose,” she said, to which Symone responded: “Well, I appreciate that, sweetheart, and I release any pain toward you that I have and I cancel, clear, and delete it.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Top 10 Disney Channel Stars Of The 2000s, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipmq6Vo3q0xcyopZ5lnJqztXnToZxmrpmaxG6yzqtknaGjo7K6ecKhmKemlaF6o8HTZq6hmaRisq2%2FxGafmqtdqLWmecGenKdlpaV6tbuMpZitnZyufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oxlade-biography-real-name-age-songs-pictures.html><span>←</span><span>Oxlade Biography: Real Name, Age, Songs &amp;amp; Pictures</span></a>
