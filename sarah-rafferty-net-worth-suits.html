Since then, the Connecticut native has booked other major TV roles. At the same time, Rafferty has also taken a number of film roles too. In the end, everything added up to quite an impressive net worth for the actress.</p><h2 id=while-working-on-suits-sarah-rafferty-took-other-roles-from-time-to-time>While Working On Suits, Sarah Rafferty Took Other Roles From Time To Time</h2><p>Suits may have been a full-time gig for Rafferty, but she still made time for other projects whenever possible. For starters, she played the lead in the Hallmark film All Things Valentine. For Rafferty<strong>,</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> it almost felt that the film was made for her</a>. “It really appealed to the romantic in me,” the actress remarked. “There‘s a hopefulness to the journeys that all the characters take and I thought that was a great message. It really excited me in that way.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the same time, Rafferty also joined the cast of the comedy Small, Beautifully Moving Parts. The film tells the poignant story of a woman’s uneasy journey to parenthood. Since its release, the movie has won a number of film festivals.</p><h2 id=life-after-lsquo-suits-rsquo-has-also-been-equally-busy-for-sarah-rafferty>Life After ‘Suits’ Has Also Been Equally Busy For Sarah Rafferty</h2><p>After wrapping up her time on Suits, Rafferty wasted no time continuing with television work. For starters, the actress signed on for a recurring role in <a href=#>the long-running medical drama Grey’s Anatomy</a>. In the series, Rafferty played Suzanne, a patient who presented with an illness that left everyone’s favorite group of doctors stumped.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Surprising Facts About Meghan Markle's Life Before 'Suits'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the end, Grey’s Dr. Riley (Shoshannah Stern) was convinced they needed to take a radical treatment approach, removing Suzanne’s medications from her system, so they can discover what’s really going on with the patient. “It’s pretty clear that even with the medication, Suzanne is going to progressively get worse,” Stern told Variety. “While what Riley is suggesting is a massive risk, I think people in general may misunderstand her intentions and think she’s comfortable with taking them because she’s uncaring.”</p><p>On the other hand, Rafferty went from playing a patient to becoming a doctor she also booked a recurring role in the NBC medical drama Chicago Med. In the series, she was cast to play Dr. Pamela Blake, a renowned transplant surgeon who is typically used to having things her way. Rafferty made her series debut in the episode entitled Change is a Tough Pill to Swallow. Since then, the actress has appeared in seven other episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-is-sarah-rafferty-rsquo-s-net-worth-today>This Is Sarah Rafferty’s Net Worth Today</h2><p>The latest estimates indicate that Rafferty is now worth anywhere between $5 and $10 million. At one point, her assets included a home in West Hollywood, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actress has since unloaded the property for a reported $2.46 million</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is Why 'Pearson' Failed To Live Up To The Success Of Predecessor, 'Suits'</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, it’s safe to assume that a significant amount of Rafferty’s current wealth came from her time on Suits. Reports may indicate that she was only paid a relatively low $25,000 per episode in the beginning, but it is more than likely that Rafferty negotiated a better deal for herself later on. This is especially true when Suits entered its final season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the same time, it is also worth noting that Rafferty has entered into some lucrative brand partnerships over the years, including one with German fashion brand Marc Cain. And in fact, as the company’s brand ambassador, Rafferty even got to design her very own Marc Cain handbag collection. “The design process was funny because I was working on Suits in Toronto and we were sending videos back and forth trying to explain how I wanted the cross body to be attached,” Rafferty told S/Magazine of their collaboration. “I was mocking up something from taking two bags, taking a video of it and putting it together.”</p><p>Meanwhile, it is unclear how soon Rafferty will be returning to Chicago Med. That said, fans are hopeful that they will see the actress again soon enough since Chicago Med had already been renewed for an eighth season back in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, Rafferty may also choose to take a brief break from acting to spend some time with her family (she has two girls). “t’s easy in life to compare and despair, but it’s important to have faith in your own path and time,” the actress once told Theluxer.com. “I think it’s about being true to yourself. Run your own race.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Much Is ‘Suits’ Actress Gina Torres Worth?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmqqRnXqzrcWfnKusqWK7psCMsKarrJhiwLa106xm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-fabulous-freebirds.html><span>←</span><span>the fabulous freebirds - Wrestlezone</span></a>
