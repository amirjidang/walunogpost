Namely, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one person shaded Kelly Clarkson for her divorce</a>, she admitted to Apple's Zane Lowe.</p><p>"I think we took it out of the interview, but I had so many interview—I was interviewing someone during this whole time for me, for the show. Hilariously enough, they're getting divorced now, but whatever. But they kinda shamed me... um... when it was announced or whatever that divorce was happening and it was like 'oh my god' this is so triggering."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kevin-costner-and-ex-christine-baumgartner.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Did Kelly Clarkson's Divorce Negatively Impact Her Net Worth?">Did Kelly Clarkson's Divorce Negatively Impact Her Net Worth?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Divorce can cause major financial turmoil, but did it affect the American Idol winner?</p><p>Kelly elaborated that the interviewee told her that 'a relationship is hard.' Kelly was offended that they assumed they knew what went on behind closed doors and what was happening in her personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kelly did admit that that person was probably "going through something," and that she had to just let it go. Yet the fact that she brought it up years later seems to indicate that she might be holding a grudge, even if she isn't keen on naming names.</p><p>Fans, however, were not content with letting it go. Instead, they did some sleuthing to figure out which celebrity dragged Kelly Clarkson.</p><h2 id=fans-think-it-was-kevin-costner-who-shamed-kelly-for-her-divorce>Fans Think It Was Kevin Costner Who Shamed Kelly For Her Divorce</h2><h3 id=the-details-and-timeline-add-up-to-kevin-being-the-one-to-drag-kelly-for-her-divorce>The details and timeline add up to Kevin being the one to drag Kelly for her divorce</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/untitled-design-7-1.jpg><p>During Kelly's chat with Zane where she admitted that a guest shading her was cut out of her show's footage, she mentioned that said guest was going through a divorce at that time.</p><p>Kelly's Apple interview was in June 2023, so fans looked back at the timeline to figure out who might have dragged her for the 2020 divorce announcement but had their own announcement in 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Looking back, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans figured out that Kevin Costner was the most likely culprit</a>, since he was on the show in June 2020, around the time Kelly filed for divorce. While he originally separated from his now ex-wife decades ago, <a href=#>Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner split up in May 2023</a> (the divorce was finalized in September of that year).</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/according-to-employees-the-kelly-clarkson-show-is-toxic-behind-the-scenes.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Kelly Clarkson Gave Her Ex A Heads Up About Her Divorce Album, Then Shaded Him On Stage">Kelly Clarkson Gave Her Ex A Heads Up About Her Divorce Album, Then Shaded Him On Stage</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kelly Clarkson might have warned her ex about her album, but then she did a cover on stage and totally dragged him.</p><p>The timeline appeared to add up, according to fans, thousands of whom were happy to agree that it was likely Kevin — now a two-time divorcee — who shaded Kelly for her marital problems.</p><p>There are a few potential issues with the theory, however. For one thing, if Kelly's show footage was pre-taped, that could mean Kevin Costner's 2020 interview was filmed before the news of her impending divorce was publicized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, when Kevin came on Kelly's show, he already had a divorce under his belt; <a href=#>Costner split from his first wife in an expensive divorce back in the '90s</a>. Yet that doesn't mean Costner couldn't have been critical of Clarkson's divorce, especially since, at the time, he was still with his wife of nearly 20 years.</p><p>Fans also flocked to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">footage of Kelly and Kevin's interview</a>, in which they suggested Kelly was very uncomfortable.</p><h2 id=kelly-39-s-interview-with-kevin-costner-seemed-awkward>Kelly's Interview With Kevin Costner Seemed Awkward</h2><h3 id=even-though-it-was-edited-kelly-seemed-uncomfortable-chatting-with-kevin>Even though it was edited, Kelly seemed uncomfortable chatting with Kevin</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>One snippet from Kelly Clarkson and Kevin Costner's interview was posted to Kelly's YouTube account. Fan comments there reinforced what many already thought: Kelly appeared uncomfortable talking to Kevin, and some parts of the interview were missing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Editing is a normal part of any interview so that part wasn't surprising to viewers. However, many agreed that Kevin's attitude seemed to hint at his criticizing Kelly, while she seemed to be speaking carefully and trying to keep the interview narrowly on topic.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title='"They Ended Up On Shows Like The One I&#39;m From," Kelly Clarkson Shaded Celebrities That Were Very Rude to Her After Winning American Idol'>"They Ended Up On Shows Like The One I'm From," Kelly Clarkson Shaded Celebrities That Were Very Rude to Her After Winning American Idol</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kelly Clarkson revealed that many of the celebrities who were rude to her after winning ‘American Idol’ ended up in similar shows.</p><p>Commenters called Kevin misogynistic and multiple viewers pointed out that Kelly talked a lot, even when she was only asking Kevin what his favorite movie was that he has acted in. One commenter suggested Kelly might have been talking a lot because she was nervous, something various commenters seemed to relate to.</p><p>Perhaps a better indicator of whether fans were right about Kevin Costner shading Kelly Clarkson is the fact that he has not returned to The Kelly Clarkson Show since that 2020 appearance. In contrast, many other celebrities have returned multiple times.</p><p>Fans can only assume that Kevin hasn't been invited back, but time may tell whether it was Costner who was rude to Clarkson, or if it was another celebrity entirely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqScrnqkuMCroqynnmLAqa3DnptmmqliuKbCyKdknKejqbumvoyfpqtll5rBtbXNoGSdoaakv6Sxw2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-bensimon-was-not-prepared-for-her-surprise-engagement.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly Bensimon Was Not Prepared for Her Surprise Engagement</span></a>
