She has a brain to boot, and she has no problem speaking her mind. She has the kind of smile that draws you in, and her worldly background can have you involved in some titillating conversation. She’s been in the media a lot these days due to her outspoken views on the world. There is something about this actress that has male and female fans going crazy. She’s the kind of girl that has a strong sense of humor and yet still has a certain mystery about her. When she started her career, she was in a few movies such as Alpha Dog and The Girl Next Door, but she got her big break when she appeared as Alex Kelly on The O.C. That recurring role made her career, and it’s been going strong ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2007, she was also part of the cast in the popular TV series, House. Named after the famous author, Oscar Wilde, Olivia continued her career appearing in various movies and music videos. In 2016 she dabbled in a documentary called Half the Sky: Turning Oppression as she is an advocate for the oppression of women. She recently directed a music video called "Dark Necessities" for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Wilde also made an appearance in a Coleman Hell’s music video called "Fireproof." Olivia Wilde is also a strong humanitarian, and she provides support while being on the board of members of Artists for Peace and Justice. The organization provides health services and education to the people of Haiti. Check out our list of 15 things Olivia Wilde doesn't want her fans to know, and see how much depth this beautiful starlet has beyond what is seen on the big and small screen.</p><h2 id=15-she-was-caught-eavesdropping-on-diplomats><strong>15. &nbsp;She Was Caught Eavesdropping On Diplomats</strong></h2><p>Olivia Wilde has spent her whole life around celebrities. She didn’t grow up in the limelight, but her famous parents certainly had access to it. She was one of many Hollywood actresses that grew up in the business, though she didn’t get into acting until she was older. Her parents are prominent journalists, and through them, she has met some fascinating people. At the tender age of just 4-years-old, Olivia Wilde found herself in a situation that included diplomat, Richard Holbrooke. She was caught eavesdropping on a conversation between the diplomat and rocker, <a href=#>Mick Jagger</a>. Perhaps she was looking for the latest scoop for her own political views. When Jagger caught her eavesdropping, he politely shooed her away from the conversation. Not everyone can say that they have the kind of life that includes walking amongst musicians and politicians.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-she-has-strong-views-on-abortion><strong>14. &nbsp;She Has Strong Views On Abortion</strong></h2><p>Olivia Wilde had never had a problem with speaking her mind, in fact, it has at times gotten her in hot water. Olivia caused a stir in the media recently when a video was released by the left-leaning Anonymous Content. The video had Olivia Wilde stating that she would be voting for the right to abortion come November because she’s “literally about to have a baby.” It was a statement that had a lot of people scratching their heads in confusion, after all, what does having a baby have to do with aborting one? Olivia Wilde plans on voting for <a href=#>Hillary Clinton</a> in the upcoming election and has strong views on abortion being a fundamental human right. “Abortion is on my mind because I’m literally about to have a baby, like in a minute.” Now that the election season is coming to an end she has reproductive rights on her mind.</p><h2 id=13-she-married-an-italian-prince-at-18><strong>13. &nbsp;She Married An Italian Prince At 18</strong></h2><p>Growing up in a world full of celebrities and other influential people can often lead young girls in Hollywood to make rash decisions. In 2003, Olivia Wilde married <a href=#>Tao Ruspoli</a>, an Italian prince. The two of them eloped in a crazy ritual on a school bus when she was only 18-years-old. The reason for the abandoned school bus ritual was because they wanted to be alone and no one knew about their secret relationship. There were only a few witnesses that attended their school bus nuptials. The Ruspoli family owns a castle in Vignanello, Italy where they had their formal wedding later on. The two were married for 8&nbsp;years before they separated. In 2011, Wilde filed for divorce citing “irreconcilable differences.” Wilde did not ask for spousal support, and the divorce did not get ugly like most Hollywood unions. They reached an agreement about property division amicably, and most people in the media have seemed to forget all about their relationship and subsequent split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-she-was-pissed-that-no-one-gave-up-their-seat-on-the-train><strong>12. &nbsp;She Was Pissed That No One Gave Up Their Seat On The Train</strong></h2><p>Riding the subway isn’t always the most enjoyable experience. In fact, it can be a smelly and cramped environment that isn't exactly the most ideal environment for a pregnant woman. Olivia Wilde made a public outcry on Twitter recently, stating her disgust that she travelled on a train and no one gave up their seat for her. Wilde was very pregnant at the time she went travelling and was upset that she had to stand while others around her sat comfortable. She posted, “NBD, able-bodied [subway] riders who won't give your seat to a GIANT preggo. I'll just stand riiiiight next to your head and pray I go into labor." No one on the train offered their seat to the pregnant actress, and she made her opinion well-known. Although she received over 3,000 likes and plenty of support, not everyone was pleased with the post that she made. One such Twitter follower posted, “@oliviawilde Pregnancy is not an illness or disability. You're rich, call Uber or catch a cab! Entitled much?”</p><h2 id=11-she-got-a-call-from-the-president><strong>11. &nbsp;She Got A&nbsp;Call From The President</strong></h2><p>Not too many people can say that they get a call from the President of the United States. In fact, it’s something that most of us can only imagine. Not for Olivia Wilde, however, she once received a personal phone call from the President during his presidential campaign. When he found out that she was involved in his campaign, he made a personal call. The call was to thank Wilde for participating in his campaign. She was once interviewed by Cosmopolitan magazine about the issue, and she stated, "I was very professional the whole time we spoke, then I hung up the phone -- or so I thought -- and started squealing for about 15 seconds." She may have thought that the phone call had ended, but in fact, the future president had heard her entire outcry, shrieking and all. He found the whole situation humorous and they laughed about it afterward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-she-had-a-famous-babysitter><strong>10. &nbsp;She Had A&nbsp;Famous Babysitter</strong></h2><p>Olivia Wilde grew up with many famous people around her, so it’s not surprising to hear that even her babysitters were famous. When it comes to the Hollywood elite, at times, they have more than one caregiver. With celebrities, the caregivers aren't always who you'd usually think of as the typical babysitter. Most celebrities trust the care of their children to nannies who provide full-time care. In this case, however, Olivia got extra special treatment. When Olivia was young, she was babysat by a bestselling author, who so happened to be a personal friend of the family. Not only that but he’s also a renowned intellectual. <a href=#>Christopher Hitchens</a>&nbsp;was one of her caregivers when her parents needed a hand. He only had great things to say about Wilde and stated that he always knew that she would be on the silver screen. "With Olivia, you could tell it was going to be the movies or stage or TV or nothing.”</p><h2 id=9-she-is-against-serial-dating><strong>9. &nbsp;She Is Against Serial Dating</strong></h2><p>Dating in Hollywood can be a nightmare, even for some of the strongest personalities. After all, it just takes going on a first date with someone before the media assumes you’re on the way to the altar. This can make for an awkward first date when celebrities have their picture splashed as front page news the next day. It can make dating hard, almost impossible at times. Olivia Wilde has been linked to many of the industries leading men such as <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a> and <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a>. Although Olivia enjoys dating, she finds the game of dating difficult and tries to avoid the media as much as possible. Olivia has stated in various cases that she is a relationship person and that she doesn’t believe in serial dating. During an interview with Glamour magazine in 2011, she said, “I wish I could play the field, but it's so not me. I go 100 percent into everything. And I'm a really good girlfriend.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-she-has-a-crush-on-angelina-jolie><strong>8. &nbsp;She Has A&nbsp;Crush On Angelina Jolie</strong></h2><p>We all have a celebrity crush, someone that we would like to date or at least have one steamy night with. Some couples even have deals that allow for a hall pass if sleeping with a celebrity is ever a possibility. Even celebrities can have crushes, and in Olivia’s case, it’s a high profile smoke show. During an interview with Women’s Health magazine, Olivia Wilde admitted that she had a celebrity crush on <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>. Angelina Jolie has certainly had an exciting life that includes infidelity, issues with her father as well as many health concerns. She is a crush for many people, being a seductive and sexy actress. Wilde stated that she is attracted to a woman who is strong and has survived many things in life. “Just seeing an actress who has been through it all and who doesn't care what other people say about her - someone who has forged her own path.”</p><h2 id=7-she-used-to-enter-pancake-eating-contests><strong>7. &nbsp;She Used To Enter Pancake Eating Contests</strong></h2><p>We all have those embarrassing things we used to do as children, things we probably wouldn’t admit to as an adult. When Olivia Wilde was younger, she liked to enter into pancake eating contests, and she often dominated. These pancake eating contests were often located in Australia, and she took the whole thing with a sense of pride. During one such pancake eating contest, Olivia admitted that she ate 33 pancakes within a 20-minute period. Although she was always a slight and thin girl, she beat out grown men that she considered to be “giants” at the time. She explained the whole process during a Women’s Health interview. Olivia Wilde is known to be a fearless and opinionated actress. She decided to enter these competitions because the organizations told her that a girl could never enter the competition. They believed that she wouldn’t stand a chance against a bunch of grown men.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-she-breastfeeds-in-public><strong>6. &nbsp;She Breastfeeds in Public</strong></h2><p>These days there has been a lot of outcry in regards to whether it’s appropriate for a woman to breastfeed her child in public, openly. Many people believe that a mother should have the right to feed her child whenever and wherever she pleases. It’s become a public debate, and many women have made Facebook or Twitter posts of them sitting in public places while breastfeeding. Olivia Wilde has no problem with speaking her mind or doing what she feels is right. During a Glamour photo shoot, she was captured on camera feeding her son. She was dressed in couture at a diner, and she was exposed while breastfeeding. Wilde later tweeted the photo with the caption, "Otis ordered milkshakes. Luckily I had some on me. Then he peed on my dress. Good kid. #boobfood #whennaturecalls." The stunning photo showed Wilde in a contemplative state while she fed her son.</p><h2 id=5-she-showcased-her-talent-by-playing-an-adult-star><strong>5. &nbsp;She Showcased Her Talent by Playing An Adult Star</strong></h2><p>In 2011, she portrayed famous adult&nbsp;star, Linda Lovelace, in a biopic movie. It was one of many roles that showcased her talents as a serious actor. Linda Lovelace was the woman who brought adult entertainment&nbsp;into mainstream media in the '70s after her X-rated flick,&nbsp;Deep Throat. Olivia Wilde considered the role a tremendous honor. Wilde did considerable research for her roles, "It's such a cool role. She was a fascinating woman—with where she came from to Deep Throat to then working with Gloria Steinem and Nora Ephron. It's really fascinating." It wasn’t the first time she played a role that revolved around a story of an adult star. She was able to showcase her talents in a TV show in which she portrayed an adult film star. The drama was one of those Romeo and Juliet stories in which the producer’s daughter was caught up in an affair with a district attorney’s son.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-she-would-rather-take-friends-out-for-dinner-than-buy-expensive-things><strong>4. &nbsp;She Would Rather Take Friends Out For Dinner Than Buy Expensive Things</strong></h2><p>Olivia Wilde has a love of cooking and is often featured in pictures that have her cooking while pregnant. She says she loves to invite her friends over and cook for them as a means of entertaining. She takes great care in cooking and oftentimes has stated that she would prefer to take ten friends out to dinner than go out and buy an expensive outfit. You certainly don’t hear that very often from a celebrity. There was one such time that Olivia Wilde shared an Instagram photo of her cooking while wearing a bikini. She was seen cracking eggs while she showed off her baby bump. At the time, she was pregnant with her second child and the photo shows her exceptionally happy while making breakfast in the morning. We can only guess what she was cooking, but judging by her reputation as a cook it must have been something delicious.</p><h2 id=3-she-s-against-the-anti-vaccination-movement><strong>3. &nbsp;She’s Against&nbsp;The Anti-Vaccination Movement</strong></h2><p>Vaccinations have become a media hailstorm in the past few years with many parents opting not to vaccinate their children. Many believe that there is a link between vaccination and behaviors such as autism. With many parents opting out on vaccinations, others are worried that it puts their own children at risk. Olivia Wilde was at it again in 2015 when she made a statement regarding her views on the anti-vaccination movement. Her beliefs come from personal experience with serious illnesses, and she believes that protecting children from diseases should be of utmost importance. The actress made a statement on social media about her beliefs on vaccination. She believes that under no circumstance should children be allowed not to be vaccinated. She made a public Twitter post that stated her opinion on vaccinations, “My dad had Polio when he was a kid. I never even have to worry about it. Don't hate. Vaccinate. #vaccineswork.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-she-was-named-sexiest-vegan-of-the-year><strong>2. &nbsp;She Was Named Sexiest Vegan Of The Year</strong></h2><p>Sometimes the word "vegan" can be taken as a swear word, but Olivia Wilde takes it as a compliment. She’s been recognized various times for her candid opinion on animal rights. No big surprise then when you hear that she was named as PETA’s Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrity in 2010. Olivia has been very vocal about the fact that she is vegan as well as vegetarian. PETA wasn’t the first organization however to award the actress with that title. In 2009, Maxim magazine recognized the star as part of their “Hot 100.” Olivia Wilde is one of the most sought after actresses in Hollywood and her looks certainly help her in that area. Not only was she recognized in 2009, but also 2014 as well. She considered both nominations to be an honor and took great pride in them. She’s been an ambassador against animal testing and works with Revlon, a company that is also against animal testing since 1989.</p><h2 id=1-she-gets-advice-from-steven-spielberg><strong>1. &nbsp;She Gets Advice From Steven Spielberg</strong></h2><p>Olivia Wilde was lucky enough to get life advice from the legendary director, <a href=#>Steven Spielberg</a>, while she was growing up. Talk about a lucky girl. Spielberg was one of many famous friends of the family and Wilde had the opportunity to meet him when she was 13-years-old. When they met in her home, Spielberg offered her an autograph as well as a note. The note was written as advice to Wilde about her future. The note that Spielberg gave to Wilde stated, “Olivia, if you want to be a doctor look before you leap; if you want to be in show business leap before you look.” It was solid advice from a legend, and Wilde kept the note, framed it and hung it on her wall. Olivia Wilde has stated that she had always been obsessed with Spielberg movies and meeting Spielberg had been a dream of hers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Daily Wire</a>, <a href=#>More</a>, <a href=#>Daily Mail</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2owrO80aKqoqaXYrOir9OsZLKnpWKxqrDNrWSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqecnsOqrYywoKWclWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-reasons-why-women-prefer-less-attractive-men.html><span>←</span><span>10 Reasons Why Women Prefer Less Attractive Men</span></a>
