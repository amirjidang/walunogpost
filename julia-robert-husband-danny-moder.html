From Runaway Bride and Notting Hill to My Best Friend’s Wedding, we have witnessed the actress represent some of the glamorous leading women.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Is Julia Roberts’s Husband, Daniel Moder?</h2><p>Unlike his superstar wife, Moder works from behind the scenes. According to the source, Daniel Moder is a cinematographer and camera operator based in L.A.</p><p>The 52-year-old studied psychology at the University of Colorado Boulder in 1992, then went on to work on his first film, Crimson Tide, as a production assistant in 1995. Since then, he’s worked on dozens of movies, and some of his most notable credits include Dead to Me, Spider-Man 3, and Mr & Mrs. Smith.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Moder Was Nominated For An Emmy Award</h2><p>​​In 2014, Moder was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Cinematography for a Miniseries Or Movie for his work on The Normal Heart. The film also earned him a nomination for the OFTA Television Award for Best Cinematography in a Non-Series.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did Danny Robert Meet Julia Roberts?</h2><p>Danny and Julia met on the set of The Mexican back in 2002. Both were in relationships, as Julia was dating Miss Congeniality star Benjamin Bratt, and Daniel was married to make-up artist Vera Steimberg.</p><p>Denying that their <a href=#>relationship</a> was the cause of Danny’s split from Vera in an interview with Oprah, the Notting Hill star explained: “<strong>He sorted his whole thing out, separate and apart from me. And I sorted my life out, separate and apart from him. I think that’s the only reason we were able to ultimately fall in love with each other and be together.”</strong></p><p>When she was asked about the T-shirt, she said: “<strong>You know what that was about? It was private. I stand by my T-shirt.</strong>“</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Julia Roberts And Danny Robert Engagement And Marriage</h2><p>Julia and Danny’s relationship has always been very low-key, so much so that rather than wearing a lavish engagement ring, Julia opted for a simple emerald ring that was reportedly purchased at a shopping center for around £3,000.</p><p>The pair tied the knot in 2002 at Julia’s ranch in New Mexico but have always kept details about their special day under wraps. According to AOL News, guests revealed that Julia wore a pink cotton dress for the ceremony, while Danny wore a ruffled shirt.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rumors Of Their split</h2><p>Despite rumors that the couple had ended their relationship after being spotted together for several months, Julia shut down the reports by sharing a lovely photo of herself enjoying a holiday with her husband.</p><p>In the photo, the pair laughed and hugged each other, and the actress wrote: “<strong>Oh Summer, thank you! You made us happy and brave. We embraced every moment of sun-drenched JOY. #familytime.”</strong></p><p>They’ve proved the rumors wrong since and look happier than ever together.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Moder And Roberts Children</h2><p>They sure do. In 2004, the couple welcomed their twins, Hazel Patricia Moder and Phinnaeus Walter Moder. And in 2007, Roberts gave birth to their son, Henry Daniel Moder.</p><p>Since the couple is notoriously private regarding their personal lives, there aren’t too many pics on their kids’ social media feeds. Still, there have been rare occasions where Moder shared snaps of their kids.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, in honor of <a href=#>Mother’s Day</a> in 2019, Moder paid tribute to Roberts with a family pic and wrote, “<strong>That pretty mama in the middle. We love you so much.”</strong></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC21KWgmmWipK%2BmvtNmn66rkpa7pXnDmqWnsV2ivKWx0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alena-kaverina.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Alena Kaverina dating?
