The My Seanna crew is getting the hang of things all while viewers get a hang of the new My Seanna crew. Although things got off to a rather pristine start, it appears as if the first primary charter guest still had some grievances to air out when it came to the interior.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the complaints, this season's cast was rewarded a whopping $18,000 tip, which ain't too shabby for their first go, especially considering<a href=#> Captain Lee Rosbach</a> was only there for half of it. While the drama hasn't set in just yet, it's only a matter of time before things bubble and boils over, and fans are certain it'll happen between Chef Rachel Hargrove and First Officer, Eddie Lucas.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Below Deck Med': What Is Spencer Lloyd Up To Today?</a></span></p><p>The duo are already butting heads and following their bumpy relationship back in season 8, it's only a matter of time before their underlying tension comes to a head this time around. Although they've managed to touch on their past drama, fans are wondering what really happened between the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eddie-called-out-rachel-39-s-drinking>Eddie Called Out Rachel's Drinking</h2><p>During their time working together on season 8 of Below Deck, Chef Rachel and former Bosun, Eddie Lucas, who has since been promoted to First Officer this time around, definitely butted heads. The duo didn't get off to the best start, and it seems as if their past issues are slowly but surely coming up this season.</p><p>It's no secret that Chef Rachel enjoys her drinks, I mean...it is Below Deck, right? Well, it seems as if she might have gotten a little too wild at times for Eddie's liking, so much that he brought it up to Captain Lee. After <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eddie called out Rachel's drinking</a>, he then referred to her behavior as "toxic" last season, which didn't sit well with Hargrove at all. The chef referred to Eddie as spineless for taking the issue to Lee and not her, and it seems as if she might not be over it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-declare-rachel-the-best-39-below-deck-39-chef>Fans Declare Rachel The Best 'Below Deck' Chef</h2><p>Fans were elated when Chef Rachel was announced to be returning to Below Deck this season, and while she definitely left a bad taste in some viewers' mouths, not to mention Eddie Lucas', it's evident that she makes for great reality TV. From her hilarious one-liners, nonchalant attitude, all the way to her tell-it-like-it-is mindset, Rachel is not only an absolute hoot to watch, but she's a stellar chef, too!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Below Deck fans were reminded as to how great a chef Rachel Hargrove really is! During tonight's episode, Rachel introduced her take of Japanese street food in a multi-course dinner, and not only did she please the guests, and Captain Lee, but she's also got us picking up our jaws off the floor.</p><p>Fans didn't waste a single moment before taking to social media to chime in on how great her food looks! "Chef Rachel is the best chef on the franchise and I will die on that hill," @IAmBelowDeck tweeted out, and they might be right! Considering the questionable chefs in the past, and of course, Below Deck Med's explosive chef Mat Shea, Rachel is definitely giving everyone a run for their money.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Think Filming 'Below Deck Med' Is Extremely Dangerous</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-do-eddie-and-rachel-stand-today>Where Do Eddie And Rachel Stand Today?</h2><p>Her cooking might be amazing, but her attitude isn't always! Rachel has been making some rather snide comments when it comes to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing feud with Eddie Lucas,</a> however, she claims that she is not holding a grudge. During an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, Rachel revealed that she doesn't care about what happened, however, her Below Deck confessionals say otherwise.</p><p>“For me, grudges mean that I would actually have to care and give significance to that issue or that individual. I don’t," she told the publication.</p><p>Rachel went on to share that her behavior doesn't fall outside of kitchen norm, claiming that “if you work in restaurants and in kitchens, my behavior is nothing different than anybody else’s,” she said. “It’s just a little bit extra emphasized.” While Eddie might choose a different word than "emphasized," fans are certainly living for every moment of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Where Is Former 'Below Deck' Cast Member Sierra Storm Now?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnqSfrHqlscKkZLCgkal6qa3PqZynnZRir6bA1p6cp2WilrCpsctmn5qql6e8t7GMmqWdZZWZsaqxjKWsnJmjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./this-is-what-tlcs-seeking-sister-wife-is-really-about.html><span>←</span><span>This Is What TLCs Seeking Sister Wife Is Really About</span></a>
