So what happens when you dial it up? You’ll get a message from The Weeknd himself, thanking his fans for taking him “from being homeless to traveling the world.” Tesfaye says he’s doing this little project because he wanted a cool and personal way to talk to his fans (and to tease the forthcoming “Pretty” music video). That’s nice and all, but he goes a step further: you can leave The Weeknd a message at that number and, no joke, he’s randomly calling some fans back.</p><p>So check out the video below and get to dialing, then make sure to go stream Kiss Land!</p><p>Watch the full video at <a href=# rel=nofollow>Idolator.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6yuta%2FHZq6enZujsbR51p6gq5xdoLa0v4ylmKecXaW%2FsLnOZq2inJWkenKDl2trbWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ufc-does-saimon-oliveira-brother-have-brother-details-to-know.html><span>←</span><span>UFC: Does Saimon Oliveira Brother Have Brother?
