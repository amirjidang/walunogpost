In reality, it was Kelly who persuaded the ex-cop to make fighting his only job. Daukaus is well-known for his outstanding performances in the octagon, often stealing the show. Let’s look at Kelly Daukaus’ life, her involvement in Chris Daukaus’ job, their marriage, and their experience as parents.</p><p>Chris Daukaus, a former police officer, is a mixed martial artist from the United States. He fights in the Heavyweight category of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.&nbsp;Daukus was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 25, 1989. Kyle Daukaus, another former UFC fighter, is his older brother.&nbsp;The North Catholic High School graduate from 2007 attended Penn State University before dropping out.&nbsp;Similarly, Daukaus made his professional heavyweight debut in October 2013.&nbsp;His UFC debut, however, came against Parker Porter on August 15, 2020, at UFC 252.&nbsp;He is rated 14 in the UFC heavyweight rankings as of August 8, 2023. In professional bouts, he has a 12 – 6 – 0 record.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-kelly-daukaus></span>Who Is&nbsp;Kelly Daukaus?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Kelly Daukaus, Chris Daukaus’ wife</strong>, is a registered nurse. She studies nursing at Holy Family University in Philadelphia.&nbsp;She is usually in the spotlight for being there to encourage and support Chris Dauukaus, which has greatly aided his career.&nbsp;Kelly attended Pennsylvania State University at some time, according to her Facebook page.</p><p>Kelly, meanwhile, earned her Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) from Capella University in 2021. Kelly also works at Cooper’s Crafting Corners, where she crafts beautiful items.&nbsp;Every year on March 20th, the mother of two celebrates her birthday, and she likes caring for her family.&nbsp;She enjoys spending time with her family. She often discusses moments of fun, struggles, and anniversaries.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chris-daukaus-marriage></span>Chris Daukaus Marriage<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The love story of Kelly and Chris Daukaus is one of camaraderie and shared ambitions. The pair married in April 2016 and have since built a solid foundation for their relationship. Their journey has seen the highs and lows of a fighter’s life, with Kelly continually supporting Chris through successes and losses.&nbsp;However, it all started in their adolescence in 2008. They’ve been dating since they were in undergrad at Penn State.</p><p>Chris proposed to Kelly in April 2014 in Disney World, taking their romance to new heights. Two years later, they returned to the location for their honeymoon.&nbsp;Despite Chris’ demanding and frequently unpredictable work, Kelly’s dedication to their marriage remains unwavering.&nbsp;Their connection has grown stronger over time, allowing them to confront life’s challenges as a pair. This past April, the couple celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=parenting-experience></span>Parenting Experience<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chris and Kelly have embraced the journey of motherhood in addition to their duties as husband and wife.&nbsp;Chris and Kelly had two children, which added a new dimension of responsibility and pleasure to their lives. Cooper Daukaus, their first child, arrived in the world in 2019. On January 21, his parents celebrated his fourth birthday.&nbsp;The joy of motherhood was multiplied when their daughter, Murphie Grace Daukaus, was born on June 24, 2022.&nbsp;Balancing the demands of professional combat with the duties of family life is a difficult task.&nbsp;Despite this, Daukaus and his family manage to maintain a harmonic equilibrium.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWVmsFur8eroKxllJbCrK3UrGSwoZaaeqyxy6WwZpyRqriiwdJmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZZGjsW63yJ2qZpyVqa6quNJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matthew-mcconaughey-sports-a-scruffy-beard-poses-with-camila-alves-20141711.html><span>←</span><span>Matthew McConaughey Sports a Scruffy Beard, Poses with Camila Alves</span></a>
