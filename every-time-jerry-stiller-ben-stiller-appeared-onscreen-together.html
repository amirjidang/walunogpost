As a comedian and actor, <a href=#>Jerry Stiller</a> raised his son, <a href=#><strong>Ben Stiller</strong></a>, in the industry, giving the&nbsp;Zoolander&nbsp;star an early interest in film. When he began acting in and directing his own projects, Ben often asked his father to be a part of the productions, leading to many collaborations over the years.</p><p>The father-son duo’s first onscreen appearances together were in shorts, including&nbsp;The Hustler of Money&nbsp;and the Oscar-nominated&nbsp;Shoeshine&nbsp;in 1987. They later moved on to&nbsp;Hot Pursuit,&nbsp;Highway to Hell&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Heavyweights</a>.</p><p>After Ben became known as a leading man, his father popped up more and more in his movies, from&nbsp;Zoolander&nbsp;in 2001 to&nbsp;The Heartbreak Kid&nbsp;in 2007. The&nbsp;Dodgeball&nbsp;star also guest-starred in a 2002 episode of&nbsp;The King of Queens, in which he played Jerry’s character Arthur’s father.</p><p>The Stillers even took their act to talk shows. Jerry reflected on his son’s upbringing during a June 1996 appearance on&nbsp;<a href=#>Late Night With Conan O’Brien</a>. “All my life, I mean, I bring this kid up. I give him things,” he said. “I coddle him practically. I practically teach him how to walk, how to get on the stage, how to make an entrance. I gave him the Fuji camera to make his first film.”</p><p>The family members’ last acting credits together occurred in 2016 when they starred in&nbsp;Zoolander 2. The sequel served as one of Jerry’s final roles too.</p><p>Ben announced <a href=#>his father’s death</a> on May 11. Jerry was 92. “I’m sad to say that my father, Jerry Stiller, passed away from natural causes,” he tweeted at the time. “He was a great dad and grandfather, and the most dedicated husband to [the late] Anne [Meara] for about 62 years. He will be greatly missed. Love you Dad.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Emmy winner later showed his appreciation for those who <a href=#>shared kind words</a> about the&nbsp;<a href=#>Seinfeld</a>&nbsp;alum after his death. “Thanks so much for the incredible outpouring of love and appreciation for Jerry,” Ben wrote via Twitter. “I know how much it would mean to him.”</p><p>Scroll down to revisit all the times Ben and Jerry appeared onscreen together on what would have been Jerry’s 93rd birthday on June 8.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Baw6a%2B2GaroqWVYremvtGyZKysmaG5pr6Mm5ynZaOptq24xKtkmqigmq6zscNmpqerk6eyprqMraagnaSdsrN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emerson-allsworth-cause-of-death.html><span>←</span><span>Emerson Allsworth cause of death</span></a>
