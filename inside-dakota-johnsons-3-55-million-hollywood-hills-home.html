In 2016, she purchased a stunning mid-century-modern house in Hollywood Hills for $3.55 million. This architectural gem was initially built in 1947 by the renowned architect Carl Maston, who had close ties with <a href=#>famous architects such as John Lautner</a> and Richard Neutra. Interestingly, the house had previously been owned by Ryan Murphy, the creator of <i>Glee</i> and <i>American Horror Story</i>, before he sold it to Johnson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><b>Johnson was immediately captivated by the house's clean lines, inviting ambiance, and unique features. To bring her vision to life, she enlisted the expertise of designers Emily Ward and Louisa Pierce from Pierce & Ward. Together, they curated a space that reflects Johnson's personality, taste, and lifestyle, incorporating custom furniture, vintage pieces, artwork, and personal mementos.</b></p><h2 id=the-unique-living-room>The Unique Living Room</h2><p>One of the most distinctive aspects of Dakota Johnson's house is the living room, which boasts a wall adorned with three oversized front doors that can be opened to connect the indoor and outdoor spaces seamlessly. On the opposite wall, three floor-to-ceiling windows can be lifted like garage doors, providing access to the lap pool and backyard. Johnson described the living room as having the feel of a tree house on a boat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The room has antique and vintage seating, a mid-century cocktail table by Harvey Probber, a fireplace, and a grand piano. Adding a touch of glamor is a large photograph by Patrick Hoelck, displayed on a vintage Paul Laszlo for Brown Saltman credenza behind the sofa. Johnson's love for crystals is also evident in the living room, as she showcases her collection gathered from various locations.</p><h2 id=the-dark-green-themed-kitchen>The Dark Green Themed Kitchen</h2><p><a href=#>Johnson's kitchen is compact yet full of charm and character</a>. She decided to paint the cabinets in a dark green color called Alligator Alley by Benjamin Moore, which contrasts beautifully with the white countertops and backsplash. The kitchen also features stainless steel appliances by Viking and Sub-Zero, open shelves, and a farmhouse sink.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The 10 Most Expensive Celebrity Kitchens Of All Time" href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Celebrity Kitchens Of All Time</a></span></p><p>The kitchen leads to a dining area with a wooden table and chairs, where Johnson likes to host her friends and family. A vintage chandelier hangs above the table, adding elegance to the space. The dining area also has sliding glass doors that open to the pool area, making it easy to enjoy outdoor dining.</p><h2 id=the-primary-bathroom-features-double-vanities>The Primary Bathroom Features Double Vanities</h2><p>Johnson's primary bathroom is another example of her ability to transform a small space into a stylish sanctuary. The cabinets were redone in a dusty-rose camel color, complementing the white tiles and marble countertops. She also installed a large tub and two separate vanities, jokingly remarking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a> that the key to a healthy relationship lies in double sinks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The bathroom benefits from a skylight that bathes the space in natural light, while a window offers a view of the surrounding trees. Johnson has added personal touches such as candles, plants, and artwork to create a serene atmosphere. Apart from the primary bedroom, the cozy property boasts two additional bedrooms and three bathrooms, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>.</p><h2 id=an-office-full-of-memorabilia>An Office Full Of Memorabilia</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the ground floor of her house, Johnson has an office filled with memorabilia from her life and career. Among the items is a photograph of her father's friend, Hunter S. Thompson, who happened to be her neighbor in Woody Creek, Colorado, where she spent summers during her teenage years. She also keeps a seating card given to her by musician Patti Smith, which contains Smith's phone number. Additionally, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E-News</a>, a photo from Johnson's appearance on SNL's 40th-anniversary show in 2015 featuring her alongside Taylor Swift, Derek Jeter, Sarah Palin, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and 50 Cent.</p><p>Johnson's love for books and music is evident in her office, with shelves filled with various topics, including art, poetry, psychology, and astrology. A record player and a collection of vinyl records by artists such as Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, and Frank Sinatra complete the space.</p><h2 id=more-key-features-of-the-beautiful-house>More Key Features Of The Beautiful House</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Dakota Johnson's stunning house reflects her taste and personality perfectly</a>. She has decorated it with custom furniture and artwork that create a cozy and eclectic atmosphere. She has also preserved some of the house's original features, such as the hardwood floors and the brick fireplace.</p><p>Johnson claims that&nbsp;her house provides a sense of stability and belonging, emphasizing on the importance of having a place to call her own, especially considering the constant changes in her schedule. Johnson also explained that having a place to return to gives her a psychological anchor, a sense of being grounded and rooted.</p><p>Dakota Johnson's $3.55 million Hollywood home is a true masterpiece of design and luxury.
