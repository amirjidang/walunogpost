Meanwhile, Larson teamed up with <b></b><a href=#><b>CeeLo Green</b> </a>to sing “Shining Star,” Dunski took the stage with Little Big Town to perform “Better Man” and Aliyah added her vocals to<b> Alessia Cara</b>’s “Scars To Your Beautiful.”&nbsp;</p><p>In the Monday, May 22, episode leading up to the finale, Blue stunned the audience with his three performances. He belted out his original song “Money on You,” sang a duet with Keys of Prince’s “Diamonds and Pearls” and delivered an amazing rendition of<a href=#> <b>Janet Jackson</b></a><b></b>’s “Rhythm Nation”&nbsp;</p><p>https://youtube.com/watch?v=JszPlO41_lo</p><p>Blue, who landed a record deal and $100,000 prize, was a surprising winner because he was the very last person selected to join the NBC singing competition during the blind auditions. Coaches Levine, Shelton and <a href=#><b>Gwen Stefani</b></a>’s team were all full, and Keys had one remaining spot. Of course, she turned her chair for the pop and R&B singer.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>Blue told <i><a href=#>USA Today</a></i> that he’ll be using his winnings to give his fiancée, Stephanie, the wedding of her dreams. “[I] can give [Stephanie] the wedding she desires and the start of a very long life together,” he said. “We had to take a lot of things away from our already stripped-down wedding. We didn’t even have wedding [invitations]. Couldn’t afford it. The church wasn’t even going to be decorated. Couldn’t afford it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2rvKqvxGaaoaqZqHqjuNSeZKeZnZqxbr%2FEmqqopl1mf27DyKelnqpdrIF5f5hvZ2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-net-worth-of-the-cast-of-dc-league-of-super-pets-ranked.html><span>←</span><span>The Net Worth Of The Cast Of 'DC League Of Super-Pets', Ranked</span></a>
