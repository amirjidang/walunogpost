He also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn’t pay his taxes</a>, and the International Revenue Service was on his neck for a $2.8 million debt. They took all his assets, and Smith was left broke.&nbsp;Will&nbsp;made a debut in acting with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</i></a>. The project was very successful, and he regained his financial status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=george-foreman>George Foreman</h2><p>Foreman had a booming career in the boxing world while still a teenager.
