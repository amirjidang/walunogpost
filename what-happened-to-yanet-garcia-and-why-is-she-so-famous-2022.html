Firstly, there are the likes of <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>, Kendrick Lamar, Heidi Klum, Jerry Seinfeld, and <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, who have all dominated their respective industries. Whether you like their work or not, they are immediately identifiable and most people can name at least one of their credits or job titles. Then there are the celebrities who are ridiculously famous for more niche reasons. They aren't recognizable to the mainstream but they do have a dedicated fanbase. Yanet Garcia is absolutely in the latter category.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a time, Yanet Garcia was simply known as "The Mexican Weather Girl". She was a magnet for men (and women) and basically anyone beauty obsessed. Playboy magazine even called her "the hottest weather girl" and stated that she "encourages people to watch the weather forecast". Without a doubt, the meteorologist became <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the most famous in the world</a>... for a time. Nowadays, she's seemingly vanished... except to those still utterly obsessed by her looks, energy, and notable confidence.</p><h2 id=why-is-yanet-garcia-famous>Why Is Yanet Garcia Famous?</h2><p>Yanet Garcia was hired as a meteorologist by Televisa Monterrey in Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico after a short yet fairly successful career as a model. Almost instantly, she became insanely popular, attracting huge ratings for the local news program. Not only was she big in Mexico, but clips from her weather segments made it on Youtube and earned her a following all over the world. While she's <a href=#>far from the only weather woman to give men heat stroke</a>, she is by far the most famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The now 32-year-old immediately caught the attention of Playboy and millions of fans on Youtube who've watched nearly all over her segments from 2013 to 2019, when she reportedly quit Televisa Monterrey and moved to America, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Bro Bible</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Rules Every Weather Girl Has To Follow</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though some may be critical of all the sexualized compilation videos on Youtube of Yanet Garcia's weather segments, there's no doubt that she capitalized on this fame. Not only that, but she appears to be extraordinarily proud of the career she has built out of her weather segments.</p><p>Yanet has proudly taken on the power she wielded during the weather forecast and even found herself in the fifth Sharknado movie because of it.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-yanet-garcia>What Happened To Yanet Garcia?</h2><p>Following Yanet's exit from Televisa Monterrey, she registered herself as a personal trainer and created her very own fitness app called FitPlan. On top of this, she announced that she joined OnlyFans, making her one of the many celebrities to move to the platform. While she may not <a href=#>make as much as the likes of Mia Khalifa</a>, there's no doubt Yanet is capitalizing on the direct-to-consumer media platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is How Much Belle Delphine Is Really Making From OnlyFans</a></span></p><p>During her time as a meteorologist, Yanet built a humungous following for herself on Instagram, Youtube, and Twitter. This not only helped her fitness program, and the modeling school she runs in Monterrey, but also her OnlyFans. When she took to Instagram to announce that she had joined the somewhat controversial platform, she immediately got over 13 million views.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'OnlyFans': Harry Jowsey Reveals Unusual Request That Helped Him Earn $1M</a></span></p><p>Now she has thousands of OnlyFans subscribers happily paying her $20 a month to view her salacious content. Yanet makes sure to identify herself a "The Mexican Weather Girl", the moniker she earned from all of her segments on Televisa Monterrey.</p><ul><li><strong>Yanet Garcia's net worth is said to be between $3 - $6 million.</strong></li><li><strong>Yante has a stunning New York apartment overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge.</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-yanet-garcia-dating>Who Is Yanet Garcia Dating?</h2><p>While she was still "The Mexican Weather Girl", Yanet got involved with Youtuber Doug Censor Martin, otherwise known as FaZe Censor of Call of Duty fame. He even flew from the U.S. to Mexico to meet her after some online flirtations. They attempted to make their long-distance relationship work despite some roadblocks such as their photo leak. He reportedly "dumped her" in 2018 so that he could focus on gaming, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to The Sun</a>. Although he stated that their relationship ended, in part, because she wanted to take a percentage of his Youtube video earnings. In any case, Yanet publicly shared that she was "heartbroken" about the whole ordeal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yanet was dating former football player now life-guru Lewis Howes back in 2021, but their relationship appears to be over. While neither of them publicly announced their split, Lewis' Instagram is filled with photos of him with a new woman. While Yanet could be seeing someone new, it appears she learned from the negative experience of dating FaZe Censor and is keeping her personal life... well... personal. On top of this, she is in control of shifting the attention she receives onto her fitness app and OnlyFans.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This Is How Much Sara Jean Underwood Makes From OnlyFans</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bsXAp5ytZZeWv6S1wGaYp5xdrLW6ecisZKyglWLAsHnFmqSoraNif3F%2BkWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-ackerley-wife-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-facts.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Tom Ackerley: Wife, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts</span></a>
