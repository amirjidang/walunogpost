Danielle Jonas (née Deleasa) was born on September 18, 1986 in Denville, New Jersey. She attended Morris Knolls High School and later pursued a career in cosmetology. Danielle was a hairdresser in her early days, building a loyal clientele. She later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">met hubby Kevin Jonas while vacationing in the Bahamas</a> in May 2007 before getting married on December 19, 2009. The pair is parents to two lovely daughters, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alena Rose</a>, born on Feb. 2, 2014 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Valentina </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina</a>, on Oct. 27, 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's easy to chalk up Danielle Jonas' status as a public figure to her being married to Kevin Jonas, but <a href=#>she's much more than a Jonas wife</a>. In fact, Danielle has worked hard to build quite <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an impressive net worth</a> for herself. While she may be overlooked because she's <a href=#>the least famous Jonas wife</a>, Danielle has made herself successful enough to stand beside <a href=#>Nick Jonas' sweetheart Priyanka Chopra</a> and Sophie Turner, whose<a href=#> impending divorce from Joe Jonas</a> has recently made headlines. From humble beginnings as a hairdresser to her current status as a successful public figure, here's how Danielle Jonas as amassed an impressive $7 million net worth.</p><h2 id=danielle-jonas-39-reality-television-stint-on-39-married-to-jonas-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Danielle Jonas' Reality Television Stint On 'Married To Jonas'</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-06t105121-481.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Danielle Jonas' venture into the realm of reality television could be seen as the first contributing factor to her now-impressive net worth. Jonas gained popularity when she co-starred on the E! reality-documentary series, Married to Jonas, alongside her husband Kevin Jonas from 2012-2013. The couple's reality TV series premiered on E! on Aug. 19, 2012, and went on to run for two seasons. The series began following the couple two years into their marriage, just as they were settling into their suburban New Jersey home.</p><p>The show brought Danielle to the spotlight alongside Kevin, establishing her as not only a hairdresser from New Jersey, but also, a reality star. Her earnings from Married To Jonas undoubtedly contributed to Danielle Jonas' net worth. Jonas was actually asked if she would<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> like to join the cast 'Real Housewives of New Jersey</a>' and politely refused. “I was asked,” she said. “But I think I would die. I think they would like, they would kill me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’d rather do Married to Jonas,” added Danielle, referencing her and Kevin’s reality show.</p><h2 id=danielle-jonas-39-net-worth-grew-with-other-television-ventures><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Danielle Jonas' Net Worth Grew With Other Television Ventures</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-08t124220-897.jpg><p>Danielle Jonas' stint on Married To Jonas was far from the end of her journey on the small screen. In addition to the reality series, Jonas has also appeared on The Rachael Ray Show alongside hubby Kevin many times, specifically a segment titled "Dinner & Drinks with Kevin & Danielle Jonas", "Kevin & Dani Jonas' Marriage Secrets" and another time when she and Kevin offered <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachael Ray their cooking tips in the kitchen</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Danielle also managed to snag a reoccurring guest host role on Fashion News Live from 2012-2015. While her appearances on television beyond Married To Jonas might be limited to a few, it has no doubt added to her net worth and further boosted her fan base.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Untitled-design.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Why Didn't Danielle Jonas Roast Kevin At The 'Jonas Brothers Family Roast'?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>While Priyanka Chopra got onstage to roast Nick and Sophie Turner did the same for Joe, Danielle Jonas had something else in store for Kevin.</span><h2 id=danielle-jonas-launched-her-jewelry-line><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Danielle Jonas Launched Her Jewelry Line</span></h2><p>Danielle Jonas' net worth continued to increase when she released her own custom jewelry line, Danielle Jonas Co. Jonas launched her namesake brand in 2018 and has released three collections since then: Moments (comprised of nameplate necklaces and pieces with birthstones), New Beginnings (filled with dainty necklaces, earrings, and rings), and Perla (consisting of designs with links and diamonds).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jonas said that her grandmother inspired her decision to start the line. "My inspiration has always come from my grandmother's jewelry and how she always had pieces that would transition from day to night so seamlessly, so when I'm designing I try to emulate her style that always inspired me," she explained to Insider.</p><p>"It's something I've always had a passion for, and I love having something to call my own that I can focus my creativity on," she added.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/the-jonas-brothers-ranked-from-richest-to-poorest-3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Jonas Brothers Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>From their career as a band to personal projects and enterprises, each Jonas brother has amassed amazing wealth for themselves.</span><h2 id=danielle-jonas-partnership-with-dreft><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Danielle Jonas Partnership With Dreft</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In late 2013, when Danielle and Kevin Jonas were expecting their first daughter, Alena, the pair decided to partner up with baby fabric detergent Dreft. With Dreft, the couple launched an app called Amazing Baby Days that allows couples to capture all the moments from their pregnancy through the first year of a child's life. It was the perfect opportunity for Danielle Jonas' net worth to grow, as she used her partnership with the company to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reveal the long-anticipated birth of the couple's first daughter</a>.</p><p>Dreft even live-tweeted Alena Rose's birth, and posted the first public photo of the baby with her mother, Danielle Jonas, on the brand's Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram feeds.</p><h2 id=danielle-jonas-39-net-worth-increased-after-she-released-her-first-children-39-s-book-with-kevin-jonas><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Danielle Jonas' Net Worth Increased After She Released Her First Children's Book With Kevin Jonas</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-08t124845-754.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Danielle Jonas continued to dip her hands in other ventures to increase her net worth, with the 2022 release of a children's book titled "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">There's a Rock Concert in My Bedroom</a>". Danielle and husband Kevin were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inspired by their daughters to release the book</a> that highlights the power of music and family — and is illustrated by Courtney Dawson. "Music has always been a foundational creative outlet in our family," the couple said in a joint statement they shared exclusively with PEOPLE.</p><p>"Now our daughters, Alena and Valentina, enrich our lives in ways we could have never anticipated," the stars continue. "The love and care they show each other on a daily basis inspired this story, and we are so proud to share how these girls not only uplift us and each other, but are creative, caring rock stars in their own right.".</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/were-the-jonas-brothers-parents-angry-when-they-took-off-their-purity-rings-after-years-of-celibacy_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Were The Jonas Brothers' Parents Angry When They Took Off Their Purity Rings After Years Of Celibacy?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The Jonas Brothers' parents Denise and Kevin Jonas Sr. must have some interesting thoughts about their sons removing their purity rings.</span><h2 id=danielle-and-kevin-jonas-release-second-children-39-s-book><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Danielle And Kevin Jonas Release Second Children's Book</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the success of "There's a Rock Concert in My Bedroom", Danielle Jonas partnered up with hubby Kevin again to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">release another book in 2023 titled "</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">There’s a Beach in My Bedroom"</a>.
