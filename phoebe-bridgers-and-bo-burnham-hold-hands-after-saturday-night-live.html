The trio even joined Chalamet, 27,<a href=#><span class=s1> for a sketch</span></a> about the popularity of <a href=#><span class=s1><b>Troye Sivan</b></span></a>, all dressing up like the 28-year-old Australian singer.</p><p class=p1>After the episode wrapped, Bridgers, 29, hit up an <i>SNL </i>afterparty with Burnham, 33, by her side. The twosome were spotted holding hands while walking in midtown Manhattan, coordinating in black. Bridgers stunned in a sheer dress with a matching choker, while the comedian opted for a blazer and trousers.</p><p>Bridgers and Burnham first sparked romance rumors in December 2022 following <a href=#>her split</a> from <a href=#><strong>Paul Mescal</strong></a>. The pair were spotted at various spots in Los Angeles and at a comedy show in New York City at the time. While they continued to quietly hang out, <a href=#><strong>Keith Urban</strong></a> <a href=#>captured them cuddling</a> in the background of his TikTok video as the two danced in the VIP section at <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>’s Eras Tour stop in Philadelphia in May.</p><p>Later that month, Bridgers addressed the <a href=#>speculation surrounding her love life</a>. “I’ve had people take more than I’m giving, and I’m giving a lot,” she told the <a href=#>Wall Street Journal</a> in May. “I’m pretty f—king transparent because I would value that in someone whose music I liked when I was a kid. Seeing any representation of any feeling and anything true was awesome to me. To be punished for that is so dark.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Phoebe-Bridgers-and-Bo-Burnham-Hold-Hands-After-Boygenius-Saturday-Night-Live-Performance-02.jpg><p>Urban, for his part, apologized in June for publicizing Bridgers and Burnham’s relationship. “Yeah, oh, I found out,” he told Entertainment Tonight. “Phoebe, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“It felt very awkward,” Urban, 56, added. “I felt bad. I was just digging on the concert! You never know what’s gonna happen.”</p><p>Bridgers took matters into her own hands in August when she seemingly <a href=# rel>confirmed her romance with Burnham</a>, posting an Instagram Story photo with her arm around a man fans believed was the comedian. The picture was taken from behind as the duo sat on a piano bench, and Bridgers did not tag Burnham.</p><p>As Bridgers moved on in her personal life, Mescal, 27, confessed in a February interview with Vanity Fair that he was “really mad and upset” that <a href=#>his split from Bridgers became “Twitter fodder.”</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I definitely feel the temptation to say the status of my whatever — that will always be there,” the Normal People alum explained at the time, noting that he did not think it would be “wise” to clarify his situation with Bridgers.</p><p>Mescal continued: “The temptation still exists to be like, ‘Shut the f—k up. This is my life. This is what’s going on. Or this is what’s not going on.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapoJ%2Bar6Z5waugnZ%2BVp8Burc2dZJunXZfCs7rHmqRmoJ%2BhsW60wKebrGWRm8GmvoysmK2topmuunnNop6hrF2htrexjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./old-man-saxon-age-net-worth-how-much-does-he-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Old Man Saxon Age Net Worth: How Much Does He Worth?</span></a>
