You know, Vince McMahon — what happened was, in case you didn’t know, I started receding. I started balding. Okay, and I knew it. I didn’t know everybody else knew it. So Vince pulls me aside one day and says, ‘Listen, you’re losing your hair. You’re going to shave your head.’ I was like, ‘Why? I’m not losing my hair.’ He said, ‘Yes, you are. You’re losing your hair.’ I said, ‘Okay, how am I gonna lose my hair? How am I gonna shave my head? I’m not just gonna shave it.’ He said, ‘you’re gonna lose it in a hair versus hair match against Edge at the next pay-per-view.’</p><p>“I said, ‘Well, that’s interesting.’ He goes, ‘but listen. We’re going to pull a rib on Edge. I’m going to pull him aside today. I’m going to tell him that we’re going to have a hair versus hair match, but I’m going to tell him you’re gonna win.’ So he pulls Edge into the office while I’m in there, and he says, ‘okay Edge, at Judgment Day, we’re going to have a hair versus hair match you versus Angle. And I want Angle to go over by tap out, and he’s gonna shave your head.’ And Edge’s face just went [boo boo face look], and he goes, ‘Vince, my head’s kind of f*cked up. I have a bunch of bumps and stuff. I don’t think I’m gonna look good bald.’ And Vince said, ‘too bad. You’re getting your head shaved.’</p><p>“So I thought Vince is gonna break it to him that day. He kept that secret until the pay-per-view. And then Vince didn’t want me to tell Edge yet until right before we went out. So not only did we not tell Edge until right before we went out, but we had to change the whole f-cking finish. Because I was slated to win, and [then] Edge was supposed to win.</p><p>“So we’re up in the gorilla. And Edge was there, and he’s all boo boo faced. He’s looking down. You could tell he’s not going to have a good match because he knows he’s getting his head shaved. He does not want to get his head shaved. And I said, ‘Edge. I just want to tell you, Vince and I ribbed you. I’m getting my head shaved.’ And he looked at me like, ‘really?’ I said, Yes. He said, ‘You’re not. You’re not bullsh*tting me.’ I said, ‘no, I’m getting my head shaved.’</p><p>“And this stupid f-cker, when he shaved my head, and this is Vince his fault. He didn’t rehearse it. So when he had the clippers, he had them on the wrong way. So when he was going over my head, it was dragging my hair and pulling it out of the scalp. And I’m like, ‘Edge, what the f*ck are you doing?’ He’s like, ‘I don’t know what I’m doing.’ I said, ‘turn the f*cking clippers around!’ So he turned them around, and he finished it up. Thank God, it hurt like a son of a b*tch.”</p><p>What are your thoughts on this Kurt Angle story? Are you surprised that Vince McMahon pulled this rib on Edge?
