But under Florida law, accusations of this nature are often brought into a divorce <a href=#>if one partner has excessively spent</a> or borrowed money. Jennifer is requesting an “unequal distribution of the marital assets in her favor." She also wants “exclusive use and occupancy” of their primary residence, a $35 million Palm Beach, Florida mansion they bought in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple have had multiple properties to their names over the years, including a current home in California.</p><p>The pair also offloaded a lavish mansion in Los Angeles earlier this year after accepting an offer that was almost half the asking price. While they originally wanted $80 million, <a href=#>Adele eventually bought the property</a> for $58 million.</p><p>Fans recently noticed that Sylvester covered up a tattoo of Jennifer with ink of his dog and Rocky cast mates, leading to speculation that the cover-up caused tension in his marriage. However, his team has denied that he intentionally wanted to cover up the original tattoo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Mr. Stallone intended to refresh the tattoo image of his wife Jennifer; however, the results were unsatisfactory and, unfortunately, unfixable," his representative told <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> .</p><p>The rep added, The Stallones are presently filming a reality show together which will debut on Paramount+." It’s unclear if Jennifer is a part of the show.</p><p>The estranged couple has released statements concerning their divorce. “While we will no longer be married, I will always cherish the more than 30-year relationship that we shared, and I know we are both committed to our beautiful daughters,” Jennifer’s statement read.</p><p>On Wednesday, Sylvester stated, "I love my family. We are amicably and privately addressing these personal issues."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sylvester and Jennifer have been married since 1997. They share three daughters together – Sophia, Sistine, and Scarlett. The pair began dating in 1998 but broke up briefly in the early ‘90s after Janice Dickinson gave birth to a daughter who was believed to be Sylvester’s child (the infant was even given his last name). The paternity was eventually disproved, and Sly went on to rekindle his relationship with Jennifer.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Megan Thee Stallion Is Suing Her Record Label For $1 Million</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTAurjVnqqtnaJiwLWty6Wmp52jYsSqssRmm6Kun6ewqrrGZp%2BipV2Ws7Wx0WafnmWYnrFuwMeeoKtlkajApsDSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sylvester-stallone-auctions-off-original-items-from-rambo-and-rocky.html><span>←</span><span>Sylvester Stallone Auctions Off Original Items From 'Rambo' And 'Rocky'</span></a>
