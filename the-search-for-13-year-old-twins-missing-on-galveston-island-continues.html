The search continued along the shoreline and in the water on Monday morning, with officials on jet skis searching and diving.&nbsp;</p><p>Family members of the missing twins were present at the site, but they were too distraught to speak on camera, and they shared a photo of the boys.</p><p>Lt. Austin Kirwin with beach patrol warned the public about strong currents and waves in Galveston, especially during this time of year, and advised parents to watch their children closely and look out for jetties and piers in the water.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>‘Nobody confirms seeing them go underwater,’ </strong>said Lt. Austin Kirwin with Galveston Beach Patrol.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>‘So essentially what happened is they were out in the water, the parents briefly lost sight of them, and they looked back up into that area, and they did not see them any longer.’&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>‘The real limiting factor for us right now is this fog rolling in,’</strong> he said at a press conference on Monday.&nbsp;</p><p>A lateral current tends to form in the Gulf waters in Galveston, which, when it hits an object like jetties, creates a rip current that pulls swimmers out to sea away from shore. The search area was expanded in light of this information.</p><p>The public is reminded to swim within their limits and stay near a lifeguard if possible. Non-swimmers and children should always wear life jackets when in or around the water.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDAx55krJ2Rp7CpecWoqWZpY2LGpq3RZqalnF2pxKq60makoqujnruoec6nZKCZnKuytMDOp2Siq5yWu6V5wqilraGeqrK0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-game-lap-dance-tia-kemp-rick-ross-podcast-1234892324.html><span>←</span><span>The Game Receives Lap Dance From Tia Kemp, Rick Ross's Baby Mother, Amid Beef</span></a>
