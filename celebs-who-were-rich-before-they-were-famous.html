Being born into families with such opportunity can allow for a higher chance of becoming rich. Many celebrities on this list were born to parents who were already famous, acting or singing their way to big paydays. Some were born into affluent families that did not obtain their wealth via acting or singing. Either way these stars were definitely rich before they became famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Take <a title="Ariana Grande Net Worth" href=#>Ariana Grande</a> for instance.
