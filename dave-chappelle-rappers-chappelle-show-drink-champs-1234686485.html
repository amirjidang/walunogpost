The comedian initially requested that the episode—which was initially teased before the Buffalo and Uvalde mass shootings earlier this year—be shelved in observance of the tragedies.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The surfaced episode was filmed at Chappelle’s Ohio venue, The Shack. The comedian, who described The Shack as “a home for our culture,” shared that the venue was the last place he saw DMX before his passing in 2021. Located inside an old car garage Chappelle purchased and renovated locations years back, numerous musicians have also passed through The Shack, including Common and Chance The Rapper.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After receiving praise from N.O.R.E. for his continued loyalty to Hip-Hop culture, Chappelle shared that he received resistance when seeking out rap artists to appear on Chappelle Show musical segments.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“When I did Chappelle Show, and I wanted to do music, I couldn’t get people to come on,” he revealed while declining to name the artists who spurned his offer. However, he did mention that the artists who said “no,” were “ni**as that you know and love and I know and love.” Yet, Chappelle seemed to hold no grudges, adding, “But in their defense, no one ever heard of the show, anything.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Another topic that was brought up during the episode was <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234634908 rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West’s prior appearance</a> on Drink Champs, during which he dissed Black Star member <a href=# id=auto-tag_talib-kweli data-tag=talib-kweli>Talib Kweli</a>, disparaging his rap skills and fashion choices. Chappelle, who says he was with Kweli when they both heard Kanye’s comments for the first time, commended N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN for delivering such an entertaining interview while placing the podcast in a class of its own.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Pop culture is a desert right now, and your show is an anomaly,” Chappelle said. “And that Kanye West interview you did was one of my favorite things that I have seen in all of pop culture in recent history. Sincerely. I f**k with Kanye, but man, I ain’t seen him like that in a minute. It was funny. It was engaging. And then this ni**a had to go in on Kweli’s hat.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Yasiin Bey, whose early support of Kanye was featured in the Netflix documentary, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234649316 rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeen-Yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy</a>, also spoke on why he bestowed the amount of praise on Yeezy that he did at the time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It was fairly obvious to me,” Bey said of Kanye’s potential. “I mean, from the get-go, where that was headed. Where it already was when we met him. He was an amazing producer. He had all of the star qualities, he was different. He challenged, in my opinion, a lot of the macho notion that’s associated with Hip-Hop specifically.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch the clip from Dave Chappelle and Black Star’s Drink Champs episode below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5mut7GMnJ%2BaqKCaua2xjKuYqaiVp8Bur8eap6mdnKGybr%2FHqK5mnKKeu6x5wqGYpqijYn5zf5Nvb29saGp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cheryl-howard-bio-kids-age-net-worth-facts-about-ron-howards-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Cheryl Howard Bio, Kids, Age, Net Worth, Facts About Ron Howards Wife</span></a>
