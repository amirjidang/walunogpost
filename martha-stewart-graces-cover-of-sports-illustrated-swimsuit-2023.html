Stewart looked as glamorous as ever with her blonde locks styled in bouncy, loose curls. Her ‘do was teamed with warm glam that included blush and a glossy lip. Elsewhere in the issue, the New Jersey native looked radiant in a red halter swimsuit by Norma Kamali. In a different shot, she gave the camera her famous pout while dressed in a metallic look by Body Glove styled with oversized Gucci sunglasses.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The most standout shot, however, is perhaps the look of Stewart — who was photographed by Ruven Afandor in the Dominican Republic — <a href=#>sipping on a martini</a> while lounging in a crochet cover up.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s1>SI Swimsuit editor in chief <strong>MJ Day</strong> explained that this year’s issue is meant to uplift women. “There is no theme — rather, there is a vision, a sentiment, a hope that women can live in a world where they feel no limitations, internally or externally,” she shared in the article. “But, the absence of a theme is not to say that [these women] don’t share certain common traits. They’re constantly evolving.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Stewart, for her part, opened up about her modeling moment on a Monday appearance on <a href=#>Today</a>. “To be on the cover [at] my age was a challenge, and I think I met the challenge,” she told hosts <a href=#><strong>Hoda Kotb</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Savannah Guthrie</strong></a>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Martha Rules author continued: “For me, it is a testament to good living. And I think that all of us should think about good living, successful living and not about aging. The whole aging thing is so boring.”&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Stewart also dished on how she prepared for the big gig. “I didn’t starve myself, but I didn’t eat any bread or pasta for a couple months. I went to Pilates every other day … I live a clean life anyway. Good diet and good exercise and healthy skincare can do all that stuff, but it was kind of fun.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s1>The TV personality previously <a href=#>shared her beauty secrets</a> via Instagram in January, telling fans that she’s never had work done.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“The light was perfect for a new selfie!!!” Stewart captioned the photo — which was taken from a salon wash bowl. The entrepreneur asserted that there was “absolutely no re-imaging” involved in her impromptu photo shoot. Stewart shared that her smooth complexion is a result of abstaining from alcohol and enjoying Pilates “every other day.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>A few hours later, Stewart followed up with “the other three selfies” she took. “My expression was better in the first one but my skin looks great in all of them,” she boasted in the caption. The interior design expert opened up further about her youthful glow, explaining that she’s never had a facelift and relies heavily on “great” dermatologists. She currently works with <strong>Dr. Daniel Belkin</strong> and<strong> Dr. Dhaval Bhanusali</strong>. Stewart concluded her post, praising “amazing facials” from <a href=#>Mario Badescu</a> “for the last forty years!”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Kus8DHmmSsrJWsrrPAjKCpmpuVqHqku9WeqWanlmLAsbvRrapmoZyhwrTA0ZqrnpxdqMSqudKuoK1lYmV%2FdHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./made-of-honor-cast-where-are-they-now.html><span>←</span><span>Made of Honor Cast: Where Are They Now?</span></a>
