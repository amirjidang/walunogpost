And some people play it up [while] some of it is real. <a href=#>People have gotten married</a> [to their] pro partners in the past. Some people just fake relationships.”</p><p class=p1>Viall<a href=#> appeared on <i>DWTS </i>season 24</a>, where he danced with <a href=#><strong>Peta Murgatroyd</strong></a>. He was<a href=#> engaged to now-ex<strong> Vanessa Grimaldi</strong> during his stint</a> on the ballroom competition show. (They <a href=#>ultimately split in August 2017</a> before Viall moved on with <a href=#><strong>Natalie Joy</strong></a> and Grimaldi, 36, found love with <a href=#><strong>Josh Wolfe</strong></a>.)</p><p class=p1>Umansky, 53, was <a href=#>spotted holding hands with Slater, 34,</a> while out to dinner in Beverly Hills on Sunday, October 22 — just days before their “Most Memorable Year” dance on the Tuesday, October 24, live show. Umansky <a href=#>dedicated the contemporary performance</a> to his now-estranged wife, <a href=#><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Nick-Viall-Theorizes-Mauricio-Umansky-and-Emma-Slater-Held-Hands-For-Votes.jpg><p class=p1>While neither Umansky nor Slater have addressed their offscreen connection, Viall said on the podcast that he “could see it being real.”</p><p class=p1>Umansky and Richards, 54, <a href=#>got married in 1996</a> and <a href=#>share three daughters</a>. (He is also stepfather to Richards’ eldest daughter, Farrah, from a previous relationship.) <i>Us Weekly </i>confirmed in July that the <a href=#><i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills </i></a>couple<a href=#> hit a rough patch in their marriage</a>, but they asserted in a statement at the time that <a href=#>they had no plans to divorce</a>. Nearly two months later, Umansky <a href=#>told TMZ that he and Richards are separated</a>.</p><p class=p1>Richards <a href=#>opened up about their marital woes</a> during the Wednesday, October 25, episode of <i>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, </i>revealing the pair are still living in the same house — just in separate bedrooms. She also reacted to the pics of Umansky and Slater.</p><p class=p1>“That was very hard to see. That hurt my feelings,” Richards told host <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>, citing the photos as <a href=#>the reason she deleted her September Instagram post</a> supporting their <i>DWTS </i>partnership “I just don’t think you hold hands like that with somebody. … I don’t know if anything’s happened yet, but obviously, there’s something there. Listen, I love him very much and we are amicable. That really did hurt me.”</p><p class=p1>Despite feeling upset by Umansky’s actions, Richards asserted that she still voted for him on Tuesday night — and sent screenshots to their family group chat for proof.</p><p class=p1>Umansky and Slater are not the only season 32 partners making waves off camera.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I mean, <a href=#><strong>Harry [Jowsey]</strong></a>, who’s also on <i>Dancing With the Stars</i>? He’s dancing with <a href=#><strong>Rylee [Arnold]</strong> </a>and that’s the fakest of the fake relationships, for sure,” Viall quipped on Thursday of <a href=#>the <i>Too Hot to Handle </i>alum, 26, and his dance partner, 18,</a> comparing the pair to Umansky and Slater. “I mean, Harry is — if nothing else — an internet pro and fairly disingenuous when it comes to his relationships. <a href=#>He’ll do anything for a click</a>. Seems like a nice guy, but … well, he’ll do anything for a vote. He remarkably gets away with a lot.”</p><p class=p1>Jowsey and Rylee, who is the youngest sister of former <i>DWTS </i>pro <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Arnold</strong></a>, <a href=#>have not addressed their relationship status</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanoZOgere1wKWjZqyYnrusv4ymmK6qmZi2sHnUppinq5uueqa5zJpkrKSRqbKzeceeo51lmJa7pb%2BMn6arZaakwaa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miley-cyrus-brother-trace-debuts-drastic-body-transformation-pic.html><span>←</span><span>Miley Cyrus' Brother Trace Debuts Drastic Body Transformation: Pic</span></a>
