Nobody’s ever told me that in my life!”</p><p>Many did not take the unawareness lightly. Jack Harlow was criticized for being a white rapper, fully thriving in Hip-Hop without knowing the facts that are common knowledge in Black culture. His supporters cited him being only 24-years-old as the reasoning, not a lack of appreciation for Black talent.</p><p>India Arie chose to use the occurrence to criticize Jack Harlow for the latter.</p><p>“Just because you make Black music doesn’t mean you know Black culture. If U don’t know Brandy’s voice when you hear it … WHO EVEN ARE YOU?” the Grammy Award-winner asked on her Instagram story according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>HipHopDX</a>.</p><p>Beyond social media debates and defense of the “What’s Poppin'” rapper, he was supported by Diddy who brought him out on stage to perform his Billboard Hot 100 No. 1, “First Class” during the <a href=#>2022 Billboard Music Awards</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e%2ForrDsmSrnaOlvK%2Bw0marqGWalrCseceaqaWnp2J%2Bc3%2BTb21saWFsfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./billy-porter-donna-kelce-guerdy-abraira-and-more-share-go-to-advice.html><span>←</span><span>Billy Porter, Donna Kelce, Guerdy Abraira and More Share Go-to Advice</span></a>
