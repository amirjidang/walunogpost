All that is known about her father is that his name is Jim Baumgartner; there is no information available about her mother. The fashionista had her university education at California State University which is located in Fullerton, from where she graduated with a degree in Business.</p><p>Christine Baumgartner’s foray into the fashion industry began with a keen interest she had always had for fashion from her younger years. She started out with modeling before branching out into designing bags out of dissatisfaction with the handbags that she kept seeing. For her, the bags she was subject to at the time had no appeal and did nothing for her sense of fashion. The most popular set of bags in her brand are laptop bags, she wanted a bag that was not only functional but was also very stylish and with this at the back of her mind, she designed the most chic laptop bags in the market. They come in faux fur merged with metallic leather and have pouches and extra pockets for accessories.</p><p>The launch of her bag line happened around the same time she was planning her wedding and the purses were so good that some were featured in the pilot episode of the show, Desperate Housewives. In an interview, the former model admitted that her husband’s influence has helped the sale of the bags and the growth of her brand.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=marriage-to-kevin-costner></span><strong>Marriage to Kevin Costner</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The first time Christine Baumgartner met Kevin Costner back in the 80s, he was still married to Cindy Silvia. In 1998, four years after his divorce and many other relationships, he met Baumgartner again at a restaurant and they exchanged numbers. The started dating soon after.</p><p>The couple went on a break in 2002 when Costner told her he was not interested in having any more kids, seeing as he already had 3 kids from his first marriage. Since Baumgartner wanted kids, they decided to take a break during which time she would wait for him to come back. The wait was not long as the couple came back together faster than many thought they would and on the 25th of September, 2004 they got married at Costner’s property in Aspen Colorado.</p><p>Christine Baumgartner and Kevin Costner have three children together; the first two are boys, Cayden and Hayes while the last child is a girl, Grace.
