The film opens with all of our favorite characters from the franchise doing their usual bits. That is, until we see that each and every one of them has been spontaneously replaced with a more famous actor. Danny DeVito, Gwyneth Paltrow and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disgraced former actor Kevin Spacey</a> all participated in the hilarious parody of a parody. However, no actor was as famous as the man who “stole” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the role of Austin Powers himself: Tom Cruise</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But how did Mr. Cruise get involved with the movie? And what were the requirements involved in his role? We have done some digging to understand what motivated the actor to take the hilarious cameo.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Tom Cruise The Same Height As Sylvester Stallone?</a></span></p><h2 id=getting-into-character>Getting Into Character</h2><p>In his temporary role as Austin Powers, Mr. Cruise let go of his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more typical action figure image</a> and let loose. The actor got totally goofy in the spoof scene titled “Austinp****,” which for him meant wearing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some totally ridiculous clothing</a>. A 2002 report by&nbsp;The Guardian&nbsp;confirms that Mr. Cruise wore “false teeth, glasses and a wig” in order to play the part. The only question that remains is: why did he agree to do it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Mr. Cruise has not&nbsp;been very public about his choice to take the role, other members of the Austin Powers&nbsp;cast&nbsp;have been a bit more candid about their own experiences doing their cameo scenes. Katie Couric, in particular, has discussed what went down behind the scenes as well as some of the strategies that film production used to convince her to take the part. According to the newscaster, a major part of her decision was the franchise’s fame.</p><p>“Industry insiders (were) predicting&nbsp;Goldmember&nbsp;(would be) a smashing success,” Ms. Couric said in an NBC special focused on her role in the film, “So, of course, I was more than flattered when... Meyers asked me to make a cameo appearance in his epic franchise.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is impossible to confirm that Mr. Cruise felt as enthused as Ms. Couric did about participating in the movie. However, the newscaster did bring up an excellent point: the franchise was extremely popular. Based on the proven success of the&nbsp;Austin Powers movies, it is very likely that Mr. Cruise saw the cameo as a good move for his career.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Does Tom Cruise Spend Most Of His Money On?</a></span></p><h2 id=a-special-kiss>A Special Kiss</h2><p>Another interesting fact about Mr. Cruise’s time on&nbsp;Goldmember is that he got to kiss <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cinema legend Gwyneth Paltrow</a> in their cameo scene. And, if the actress has anything to say about their chemistry, it’s that sparks basically went flying the minute that their lips touched.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, Ms. Paltrow opened up about that firey kiss<i>, </i>according to a report by&nbsp;Daily Mail. A full eight years after she and Mr. Cruise acted out that onstage make out scene, the actress could not stop talking about what really went down. “He was an amazing kisser,” Ms. Paltrow said of her co-star.</p><p>Was the kiss at all the reason that Mr. Cruise signed up for the cameo? It’s hard to say for sure. But we certainly hope that the actor loved the experience as much as Ms. Paltrow did!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did Tom Cruise And Nicole Kidman Have A Happy Marriage?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbaledOopGaboqq2tLGMmp6rnZViwbB5wGaamqWVpHqquoyarKysmaN6sbvWnqmsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-comedian-mike-goodwin-everything-to-know-about-him.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Comedian Mike Goodwin?
