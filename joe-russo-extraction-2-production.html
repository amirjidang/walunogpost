The film, starring <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth</a>, was adapted from Andre Parks' novel, Cuidad, and details the ordeal mercenary for hire Tyler Rake is put through as he tries to fight his way through Bangladesh in an attempt to get the son of a drug dealer to safety.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The movie ended with a huge question mark, with Hemsworth's Rake character getting shot right after finishing the job. Whether he succumbed to the wound or not is left to the imagination but, fortunately, a sequel has been greenlit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Previously:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Here's Why Endgame Writers Didn't Want To Kill Thor" href=#>Here's Why Endgame Writers Didn't Want To Kill Thor</a></span></p><p>Extraction 2 is in the works and, according to writer Joe Russo, will head into production at some point in 2021. While Hemsworth will reprise the role of Tyler Rake, we can't say for sure he survived as Russo refused to be drawn into revealing whether the events in the upcoming movie take place before or after the 2020 release. It appears he wasn't sure which direction it would go in himself.</p><p>"We’re not committing yet to whether that story goes forward, or backward in time," Russo noted in May after confirming he would be taking charge of the writing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to Collider</a> back in May, the writer revealed Netflix was excited to get the ball rolling on a second part&nbsp;having expressed delight over Extraction's reception.</p><p>Following several months of silence on the sequel's progress, Russo spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ComicBook.com</a> this week and indicated the film is likely to go into production in 2021. At least that's the intention.</p><p>"We're in the script phase right now but we're hoping to shoot that sometime next year," he said. "And then you know, say I'm super excited, Hemsworth's super excited, Netflix is excited so it's really just a function of getting the script done."</p><p>Russo didn't divulge anything where the plot or location are concerned and the uncertainty over whether&nbsp;scripting will move forward or backward still looms. It appears we'll just have to wait for Extraction 2, but we can continue to imagine Rake surviving&nbsp;his potentially fatal gunshot wound.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Wonder Woman 1984 To Debut On HBO Max Alongside Theatrical Release" href=#>Wonder Woman 1984 To Debut On HBO Max Alongside Theatrical Release</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8monGaqpajAsHnEsaurmZOptrC6jGtkqaqfmcKkwMiopWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./megan-fox-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Why Megan Foxs Net Worth Is On The Rise Despite A String Of Flops</span></a>
