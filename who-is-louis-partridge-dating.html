Partridges's character is the love of <a href=#>Millie Bobby Brown’s</a> titular character, Enola. A <a href=#>part that Partridge hoped that he would get after not being the best student </a>in school. Fans rejoiced when Partridge and Brown's chemistry remained in the Netflix sequel as the two got down to solving mysteries and shaking down dangerous adversaries while navigating their blossoming romance.</p><p>Since the first film, there has been speculation from fans that a real-life romance was afoot between the two. However, not only was it later confirmed that <a href=#>Brown had been dating Jake Bongiovi</a>, the son of rocker Jon Bon Jovi, since 2021, the two are now engaged.</p><p>As for Partridge, his romantic life mostly flew under the radar. That is, until filming wrapped on Hulu’s Pistol and fans noticed some very curious social media flirtations between him and his co-star, who is older and has ties to the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated December 2023:</strong>There is much less speculating these days as to who Louis Partridge is dating. The actor is reportedly dating Olivia Rodrigo. The two have been spotted out sharing some PDA and looking very happy together. The two have reportedly been dating since October 2023, after Rodrigo and Partridge both split from their previous partners in 2022.</p><h2 id=louis-partridge-dated-sydney-chandler>Louis Partridge Dated Sydney Chandler</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar52486798-1.jpg><p>The craft might run in the family for Sydney Chandler. Her father is none other than Kyle Chandler, who played everyone’s favorite mentor, Coach Taylor, on Friday Night Lights. And despite the success that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her dad had on his hit TV series</a>, Chandler had no intention of following in Kyle's footsteps.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“My dad’s an actor, and so you never want to do what your parents are doing," Chandler explained. "So I stayed very far away from that. And then I wanted to be a vet, and then I think it was my last year of high school when I was failing my math and my science, I was like, 'maybe not.'"</p><p>Chandler settled on creative writing but when she took an acting class to do a character study on writers and actors, she fell in love with the medium. With a push from her acting coach, Chandler said, “It all just kind of went from there.”</p><p>After appearing in a few shorts, 2022 marked a big year for Chandler, who booked the much-talked-about, Don’t Worry Darling, and then, Pistol.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/millie-bobby-brown-blames-her-homeschooling-experience-for-her-lack-of-desire-to-go-to-college.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Millie Bobby Brown Blames Her Homeschooling Experience For Her Lack Of Desire To Go To College">Millie Bobby Brown Blames Her Homeschooling Experience For Her Lack Of Desire To Go To College</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Millie Bobby Brown had a unique educational experience, and she had no interest in going to college afterward.</p><h2 id=how-louis-partridge-and-sydney-chandler-met>How Louis Partridge And Sydney Chandler Met</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar51653137-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Partridge and Chandler made one another's acquaintances when they both worked on Pistol. While this did not air until 2022, the series was shot back in early 2021. Despite Partridge being 17 years old and Chandler being 24 years old, the two appeared to hit it off and started a quiet relationship with one another.</p><p>On an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">April 2021 Instagram post</a>, fans noticed some flirty comments that Partridge and Chandler were making to one another. After rumors started swirling that there was something going on between the two, the comments were turned off. The reaction to the speculation gave fans a clue that something might be brewing between the Partridge and Chandler.</p><p>Months later, after filming wrapped on Pistol, Internet sleuths following Chandler’s Instagram stories suspected that the pair might have hung out in Los Angeles and had also made a trip out to the Californian desert.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after, the two became Instagram official, with Chandler uploading photos that hint the two might be something more than friends. In the snaps, Partridge and Chandler are captured cuddling and having dinner with Chandler's famous father.</p><p>Following the Instagram official post, a series of photos in December 2021 show Chandler traveling across the pond to spend time with Partridge. The pair jaunted across picturesque cities like London and Paris and cemented their relationship with more photos on their grids.</p><p>While May–December romances have become more common, the issue with fans might be the fact the couple met when Partridge was 17. While the age of consent is 16 in England where Partridge is from, fans voiced their concerns nonetheless. This did not deter Partridge and Chandler from dating as the couple was seen in Venice for the Venice Film Festival for the premiere of Don’t Worry Darling. Chandler was cast in the film in the role of Violet, the newest resident of the unsettling picturesque town.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the concern for the age difference between Partridge and Chandler, that flew under the radar in Venice as there was drama surrounding the film’s stars Olivia Wilde, Harry Styles, and Florence Pugh. Partridge made it onto the red carpet as Chandler’s date, and the actor even took <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on boyfriend duties, adorably holding onto Chandler’s purse</a>.</p><p>However, this romance was not meant to be. And while it was never confirmed when Partridge and Chandler broke up, it can be confirmed that Partridge has a new romance in his life. That person is <a href=#>Olivia Rodrigo</a>.</p><h2 id=how-olivia-rodrigo-and-louis-partridge-met>How Olivia Rodrigo And Louis Partridge Met</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar53207146-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Early in 2023, Rodrigo was introduced to Partridge through mutual friends. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The two hit it off and spent time messaging one another over the next several months.</a></p><p>In October 2023, Rodrigo flew to London to see Partridge.
