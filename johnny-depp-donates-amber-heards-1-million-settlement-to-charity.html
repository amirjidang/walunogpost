While they said they received $1.3 million from Amber, they hadn’t received the full $3.5 million promised.</p><p>The charity’s COO Terence Dougherty said on the stand that Amber claimed she was having “financial difficulties” when they attempted to collect the money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Prince Harry & Meghan Markle’s Son Archie Spoiled By Lavish 4th Birthday Gift</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>CNN</a>, <a href=#>CNN</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3sLTNp7BmnJWlvW6wzqeYrZ2jYq6ursSrZKGdkaextHmQZqSipJyevK950p6rraSVorKvwIytpmabmJa%2FqsDYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joan-crawford-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Joan Crawford Net Worth How Much Is Joan Crawford Worth?</span></a>
