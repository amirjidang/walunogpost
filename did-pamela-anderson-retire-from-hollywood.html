She's usually making the headlines <a href=#>for past relationships</a>, or of course, the recent biopic 'Pam & Tommy', <a href=#>one she didn't want anything to do with</a>, and still doesn't.<span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Did Pamela Anderson Get Paid For The Rights Of 'Pam And Tommy'?</a></span>It seems like in the recent months, Pamela Anderson has pressed pause on her Hollywood life and instead, she's hitting the Broadway stage in New York for the play Chicago. Pam is having a blast in the role and although it is a short-term project, Anderson recently revealed that she has long-term aspirations on stage. With that being said, did she quietly retire from film and TV projects? Here's what we know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-pamela-anderson-quietly-retire-from-hollywood>Did Pamela Anderson Quietly Retire From Hollywood?</h2><p>Pamela Anderson's obvious breakout took place during her time on 'Baywatch'. Despite the success of the show, <a href=#>Anderson revealed that not only did she avoid watching the series</a>, but during, she was never very confident in herself either. She discussed her time on the series alongside Interview Magazine.</p><p>"I never felt really confident in what I was doing in the past. I don’t regret Baywatch. It was a positive experience for me, and it did me a lot of good. I mean, a lot of good! But, c’mon, what was I supposed to do? Go home and have Baywatch parties and have my friends come over and watch me on television?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’ve never seen an episode of Baywatch. I can’t watch myself on television. Believe it or not, neither could Tommy [Lee].”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Pamela Anderson Refused To Speak With This Actress Ahead Of Her Biopic</a></span></p><p>As of late, Anderson wasn't doing anything too notable in terms of work on film or TV, however, the 'Pam & Tommy' series did draw in a lot of press.</p><p>It is well-known by now, Anderson was not happy with the project and stated she won't be watching. Nonetheless, she did reveal that her true story will come out one day down the road.</p><p>Though in truth, it might not be any time soon as her current priorities seem to be tied up elsewhere, outside of Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pamela-anderson-is-loving-the-broadway-life>Pamela Anderson Is Loving The Broadway Life</h2><p>In a twist nobody could have predicted, Pamela Anderson was all smiles making her Broadway debut as Roxie Hart in the classic, Chicago. <a href=#>Anderson is gushing over the experience</a>, loving every minute of her work on the stage.</p><p>"I'm like a sponge. I'm just soaking it all in," she said. "Every single experience has been just wild. I mean, it's wild to even be here. I have to pinch myself sometimes because it seems so surreal," the star stated alongside People.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Would Pamela Anderson Ever Be Interested In A 'Baywatch' Reboot?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the role is for a limited time, Anderson might be looking at this as a long-term situation, putting her Hollywood days on the back-burner. According to Anderson, this might be the start of something she does for the rest of her career.</p><p>"This is the beginning of the rest of my career — maybe," Anderson continued.</p><p>"I needed this right now," she said. "I feel like this is something I really needed to sink my teeth into. I love to work. I love to work hard. You know what, I kind of thought, 'Well, I'll just kick back and take it easy.' It's like, 'Oh no, no, no. I still need to work. I'm not that old yet!' "</p><p>"I have nothing to lose. I've got nothing to live up to and I've got nothing to lose. I'm going crazy. I'm going for broke."</p><p>Up until June 5th, Anderson will be appearing at the New York City's Ambassador Theatre. Who knows, if all goes well, maybe it'll be for a lot longer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anderson-s-career-priorities-have-shifted>Anderson's Career Priorities Have Shifted</h2><p>It should be noted that a big reason for Anderson's newest project has to do with a change in mind-set. Anderson revealed she's no longer caring about what the media has to say, especially when it comes to negativity.</p><p>“Look, what I’ve gone through has only made me stronger. Anything you survive does. And I’ve learned a lot of lessons about patience and separating myself from all the garbage. One of them is that you have to believe that everything is a blessing, even if it’s one in disguise. You can get through it if you trust that it’s all for a reason.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anderson is definitely living up to her words, at the age of 54, starting an entirely different project in her life and one nobody could have predicted.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Pamela Anderson's Real Thoughts About Marriage</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdpa6uscuaZJqmlJq%2FtLvNZqmerJmnsm6y0aikZqCfobm6w86om2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./demi-lovato-wrote-cool-for-the-summer-about-a-famous-woman.html><span>←</span><span>Demi Lovato Wrote Cool for the Summer About a Famous Woman</span></a>
