In 1994, he purchased the team for $88 million. Back then, the Timberwolves have only been in the league for five years and have only won 29 games.</p><p>The team is currently based in Minnesota, but if Rodriguez would be able to secure a deal, he could bring them back to the Pacific Northwest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last year, Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez tried to <a href=#>buy the New York Mets</a> but they lost to hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen. The latter purchased a majority stake in the team for $2.475 billion.</p><p>Prior to reaching a final decision, the A-listers made a desperate pitch to the New York Mets. They said that they will be giving $100 million to the team if they win a win in a World Series within the first 10 years of Rodriguez and Lopez’s ownership.</p><p>After learning that the decision won’t most likely be favorable to them, Lopez released a statement saying that <a href=#>they are not giving up</a>.</p><p>“We are New Yorkers and we are not going to give up. We feel we have the best bid for the sport, the team, and the city,” she said.</p><p>Months later, a decision was made and the couple lost their bid. Still, Rodriguez maintained a positive outlook through it all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While at Sportico’s Business Beyond the Game event, the former baseball player <a href=#>shared his plans for the New York Mets</a> if his deal pushed through.</p><p>“When we looked at the Mets, we looked at it as intellectual property. … We looked at this as an entertainment sports media platform. And we thought baseball was just a small part of it. But through Jennifer we could, we could drive the music with Live Nation business at Citi Field. With e-commerce we thought we had Mark Lloyd, best in class, what he’s done with Walmart, we could do the same with the Mets,” he said.</p><p>However, the team’s supporters were not thrilled with what they heard. After all, Rodriguez made it seem as though the New York Mets will become an entertainment sports media platform.</p><p>With this, one can only hope that Rodriguez finally <a href=#>secures a deal</a> with a team that he can help.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez & Alex Rodriguez Reunite Through New Business Deal</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Source: <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=#>Fansided</a>, <a href=#>Yahoo!
