So, let's shine a light on how much the cast is still making from the show.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-the-cast-of-39-friends-39-still-making>How Much Is The Cast Of 'Friends' Still Making?</h2><p>TV fans during the 1990s were treated to some of the very best shows of all time. Thanks to the amount of great offerings on the air, it wasn't easy for a show to break away from the pack. In 1994, Friends made its debut, and it took no time at all in leaving most other shows in its rearview mirror.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring a talented cast of younger performers who were perfect for their roles, Friends had everything going for it. It is a great example of a show being in the right place at the right time, and in the blink of an eye, it was a powerhouse that millions of people were tuning into each week.</p><p>While it was on the air, Friends was able to embed itself in pop culture, and it has maintained its place there for decades. The show remains as popular and as loved as ever, and it still manages to rope in legions of fresh fans who are watching it for the very first time.</p><p>People still want to know more about the show, notably how much money the cast was making during the show's prime.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The One 'Friends' Episode Matthew Perry Refused To Film</a></span></p><h2 id=the-cast-of-39-friends-39-made-a-fortune-in-its-10-year-run>The Cast Of 'Friends' Made A Fortune In Its 10-Year Run</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the best parts about being on a hit television show is that all the lead actors are going to make an abundance of cash. In what should come as absolutely no surprise to fans out there, the cast of the show was able to make millions of dollars while the series was still on the air.</p><p>While they did not start out making a massive amount of money, as the show continued to grow in popularity, their salaries continued to increase. Eventually, things hit a record-high for the lead stars on the show.</p><p>"The final two seasons of Friends propelled the cast contracts even higher, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest-paid actresses at the time of signing. For seasons 9 and 10, the cast agreed to a $1 million-per-episode deal. By the end of season 10 alone, the cast made a total of $22 million," writes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cast of the show was able to make millions during their time together, and as many fans know, actors still get paid thanks to syndication. What people may not know, however, is that the cast of Friends is making millions to this very day.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Matt LeBlanc Initially Refused To Film This ‘Friends’ Storyline</a></span></p><h2 id=the-main-6-on-39-friends-39-are-still-making-millions>The Main 6 On 'Friends' Are Still Making Millions</h2><p>So, how much money is the cast of Friends still making from the show? Well, thanks to a nice little detail in their contacts years back, the cast is still hauling in millions each year, and they will continue to do so as long as the show remains popular.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Well, through the magic of syndication revenue, Friends pulls in a whopping $1 billion each year for Warner Bros. Here's the kicker though: That translates into about a $20 million annual paycheck each for Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, who each make 2% of that syndication income. $20 million. Each year. For doing nothing," reports <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>.</p><p>This is an insane amount of money, and we need to remember that it is only possible because of the contracts that the cast signed. For those contracts, they negotiated a portion of profits, and they did so while also netting a huge salary. Other actors from hit shows have tried pulling off similar contracts, but they were unsuccessful, making the cast of Friends a rare exception.</p><p>Because of the money that they continue to pull down each year, the cast of Friends really doesn't need to work anymore. Despite this, however, they have tried to remain busy throughout the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think Matt LeBlanc Would've Been Kicked Off 'Friends' Had He Done This To Jennifer Aniston Today</a></span></p><p>It is pretty remarkable to see what the cast was able to accomplish with their salaries, and you had better believe that actors have been trying to follow in their footsteps for years.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Matthew Perry Completely Lost It When Matt LeBlanc Messed Up His Line On 'Friends'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIympqedqWK2tHnToZxmm5GowW67xWadq6GVo7G0edKtoKWkXaKurLXNoGStp5SWxnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-jon-bon-jovi-became-one-of-the-biggest-rockstars-in-the-world.html><span>←</span><span>How Jon Bon Jovi Became One Of The Biggest Rockstars In The World</span></a>
