Rose reiterated his support for Udoka and questioned why the Celtics staffer who was allegedly involved with Udoka had not been publicly identified.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We know his name, maybe I’m missing something as it relates to the law, but why we don’t know her name,” he reportedly said during <i>NBA Countdown</i> . “It’s not like she’s a minor. I think we should know her name publicly, as well.”</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>The Affair's Dominic West Will Play Prince Charles In The Crown Season 5</b></a></span></p><p>The former NBA player apologized for the comments during halftime of the Boston Celtics-Chicago Bulls game, per <a href=#><i>Complex</i></a>.</p><p>“I would like to apologize for a comment I made earlier on <i>NBA Countdown,</i> ” he said. “I questioned why a woman’s name who had an alleged affair with Celtics head coach Ime udoka was not made public. After an internal investigation, and it was discovered that she was a subordinate to the head coach, I now understand fully why her name should not be released to the public.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Rose backtracked quickly, issuing an apology later in the night.</p><p>“I’m Jalen Rose and I would like to apologize for a comment I made earlier on NBA Countdown,” Rose said. “I questioned why a woman’s name, who had an alleged affair with Celtics head coach Ime Udoka, was not made public. After an internal investigation, and it was discovered she was a subordinate to the head coach, I now understand fully why her name should not be released to public. Now back to our NBA coverage.”</p><p>Udoka is expected to be the next head coach of the Nets, though it has yet to be officially announced. Udoka was suspended for the entire 2022-23 season by the Celtics for violating team policies, and they were willing to let him talk to Brooklyn after the open coaching gig, per <a href=#><i>Masslive.</i></a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Celtics players have expressed frustration that Udoka is headed to a talented division rival, most notably Marcus Smart. Others said they’re focusing on their own team, while still congratulating their old coach. Udoka impressed in his lone season with Boston, guiding the Celtics to the NBA Finals while putting together an impressive midseason turnaround.</p><p>Udoka addressed the decision in a statement to <a href=#><i>ESPN</i></a> in September.</p><p>“I want to apologize to our players, fans, the entire Celtics organization, and my family for letting them down,” he said. “I am sorry for putting the team in this difficult situation, and I accept the team’s decision. Out of respect for everyone involved, I will have no further comment.”</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Jay-Z And Jeff Bezos Reportedly Planning To Buy Washington Commanders</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Complex</a>, <a href=#>ESPN</a>, <a href=#>Masslive</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3orjEp2Srp6OaeqK8zqWmoKGqmrFuss6rZKKllWLCpbvKmqpmmZyhsqixw2aYn56Rnr9ur86mpJ6mpKh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jadeveon-clowney-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jadeveon Clowney Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
