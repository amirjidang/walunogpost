Her opportunity to do so came with her role in the first season of HBO's True Detective back in 2014, where she played Lisa Tragnetti.</p><p>Although she was given only a small role on the show, it opened even more doors for her and increased her visibility in Hollywood.

I remember I was not getting into audition rooms for roles I really thought I was right for, and I was struggling to be taken seriously like every actor has."</p><p>Daddario played the character of Lisa Tragnetti, a court reporter who becomes involved with Woody Harrelson's character, in the first season of True Detective.

And if not, I need to build a rich enough life apart from that to be happy. I didn't expect to be invited. It was only afterward in retrospect when I was at the Emmys that I was like, 'Wow, I’m a big enough part of this show to be invited to the Emmys on behalf of the show even though I’m not nominated.' But it was just something that I don't think anybody expected including myself. I really didn't expect people to have that reaction to that character the way that they did."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-other-projects-has-alexandra-daddario-starred-in-after-true-detective>What Other Projects Has Alexandra Daddario Starred In After True Detective?</h2><p><a href=#>Alexandra Daddario has an extensive list of film and television credits post-True Detective.</a> In 2014, she appeared in the zombie comedy Burying the Ex, followed by a leading role in the disaster film San Andreas in 2015, alongside Dwayne Johnson.
