As we would come to realize, Hulk’s imposing ways weren’t just part of the show for entertainment purposes, Hogan was very much on the defense when it came to anything related to his daughter. Of course, it would land Hulk in hot water, thanks to a racial slur caught on tape.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooke was quick to defend her dad</a> when the story broke;</p><p>“For those who think you know my father, remember who you are. We all can make mistakes and carry ugly scars,” she continued (via Us Weekly). “Because I know my father, I can promise this – Just like you and I, things we don’t mean can sometimes slip. We all continue learning. This life can be so rough… So if you know my father, please try not to be tough.”</p><p>Media and others didn’t go easy, Hulk was let-go by WWE as well for a brief time period. Brooke would also issue a poem, once again defending her dad’s honor. Amid all the controversy, the question remains, where do the two stand at the present moment?</p><h2 id=a-rocky-history-of-being-over-protective><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>A Rocky History Of Being Over-Protective</span></h2><p>Although he brought fame to the family’s name, some might argue that it turned into negative fame very quickly. Hulk’s over-protective ways did more harm than good – it is said that Hulk would also get involved during Brooke’s relationship with former NFL player Phil Costa. At a time, the two were engaged and set to get married – however, it all went downhill once Costa got into it with Hogan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite all the hardships, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooke has constantly taken her father’s side</a> – even during his worst moments. Brooke is adamant that her dad had an out of character moment when caught using slurs;</p><p>"I understand when people are writing me mean tweets and saying your dad's this and [that] ... [but] I wish I could talk to them and just say, 'Have you ever been really mad at somebody and just said the worst about them?' ... It's not that my dad thinks that, and that's not how we were raised."He's so nice to everybody," she added. "He doesn't talk like that, which is what was so strange about it."</p><p>The question is, does Hulk feel the same way, and is he one the same page with his daughter these days?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">If He Could Do It Over Again, Hulk Hogan Would Have Stayed Away From Reality TV</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-bond-is-still-closer-than-ever><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Bond Is Still Closer Than Ever</span></h2><p>In short, the answer is yes, the two are still very close. Given her recent IG post, Brooke admitted that leaving her dad behind after paying him a visit in Florida is never easy. She also issued an emotional IG mention to her dad on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Father’s Day</a>, clearly, the bond is still greater than ever, despite the past;</p><p>“Happy Father’s Day to my daddy. Through all the ups and downs life has given us, you’ve shown me the meaning of unconditional love. You are a special soul on this earth and you have brought so much joy and light to the world even if you had its weight on your shoulders. You’re a warrior. I love you.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That same closeness doesn’t appear to be apparent with the entire family. There seems to be a gap between Linda and Brooke – give Brooke’s IG a scroll and rarely does she ever mention anything about her mom. We know by now, the two have a bumpy relationship that all started once Hulk and Linda called it quits.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Hulk Hogan Rose Back Up To A $25 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=she-doesn-t-mention-linda-neither-does-hulk><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She Doesn’t Mention Linda… Neither Does Hulk</span></h2><p>Linda went on a spiral of her own following the separation. She literally dated a teenager for a brief time period, Charlie Hill. It brought shame to the family name, so much so that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooke put her own mom on blast</a> to the media;</p><p>"I'm the only one with my head on straight," she tells E!'s Daily 10. "I don't know what's wrong with mom…dad and brother are doing good. I'm staying straightforward. I’m just looking at how my dad's treating me and how my mom's treating me, and my mom has kind of backstabbed me a couple times." "I feel betrayed," she adds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We have reason to believe the relationship hasn’t been the same since. Hulk has kept quiet, while Linda has continued to bash her former husband every chance she gets.</p><p>By the looks of it, it seems as though Linda maintains a closer relationship with Nick Hogan, the forgotten son who seems to be keeping things on the DL these days.</p><p>We’ll never know the full details around the current family dynamic, though we can safely say that things are more than okay between Brooke and Hulk.</p><p>Sources – Rolling Stone, ET Online, IG & Klaq</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT -<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Questionable Brooke Hogan Moments, In Photos</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0eceuo6RlkaOxbq7RqKaknV2dvKitzaxkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXZjCs77Ep6ulsV2htqyxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-c7rn-mean-in-roblox-c7rn-roblox-meaning-explained-11872-html.html><span>←</span><span>What Does C7RN Mean in Roblox?
