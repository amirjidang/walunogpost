The last two years were hard on writer, Darren Star. His Netflix hit Emily in Paris was bashed by the French media after its season 1 release in 2020.

<a href=../../../heres-why-the-original-punky-brewster-was-canceled.html></a>
The show 'Punky Brewster' was epic for its era. Not only did it cast a little girl as the lead in a sitcom, something that hadn't really been done in&nbsp;Hollywood&nbsp;yet, but it also explored topics that most family-friendly shows tried to shy away from. An entire generation remembers the show fondly, which begs the question, whatever happened to it? But with the throwback series poised for a comeback — and with Soleil Moon Frye as the lead — it's the perfect time to talk about why the original show was canceled in the first place.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Heres Why Fantastic Four 3 Never Happened</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>

While such Marvel comic book heroes as Spider-Man and&nbsp;Iron Man have gone from strength to strength on the big screen, the same cannot be said of the Fantastic Four. When looking at the&nbsp;best Marvel movies outside of the MCU, you won't see Marvel's so-called 'first family' on any ranking lists. Their movies (to quote the Human Torch) haven't so much as 'flamed on,' but rather 'flamed out,' which is quite surprising considering the success of certain other Marvel franchises.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Jenna Fischer And James Gunn Stayed Close After Their Failed Marriage</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>
