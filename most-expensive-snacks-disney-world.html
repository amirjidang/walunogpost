For those interested, there is a goblet available to keep for $9.99.</p><h2 id=chesire-cat-tail-5-85>Chesire Cat Tail ($5.85)</h2><p>Who doesn't love a good pastry? Well, for those that do you are in luck as the Magic Kingdom has a delightful pastry option that is known as the Chesire Cat Tail, which is a personal favorite.</p><p>This is located at the Chesire Cafe just next door to the Mad Tea Party in what is a dedicated Alice in Wonderland section of the park. However, the Cafe is tucked away and therefore a lot of people actually don't know about this.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> The 10 Most Expensive Pieces Of Walt Disney World Merchandise, Ranked</a></span></p><p>However, the pastry, that is filled with chocolate and has an icing drizzle as well as chocolate chips is one of the very best snacks available in Disney and is one every guest should try if they can.</p><h2 id=dole-whip-float-5-99>Dole Whip Float ($5.99)</h2><p>If you have ever been to Disney World, then you have heard of the Dole Whip, with this being one of the most popular snacks available, with people going out of their way to get one of them on every single trip.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Disney has now merchandised the Dole Whip due to its popularity, with pins, plushes, and even t-shirts being available. While the Dole Whip soft serve itself is amazing, adding it to the juice as a float is the most popular option.</p><p>The price for this comes in at $5.99, which isn't too bad considering it will certainly refresh you on a hot day in Orlando. Plus, if you are of age, there is an option to add rum to this, bringing the price to $10.</p><h2 id=baked-mac-amp-cheese-6-49>Baked Mac & Cheese ($6.49)</h2><p>Animal Kingdom is home to some incredible food, and at the Eight Spoon Cafe, you will find another amazing snack, especially if you are a fan of Macaroni & Cheese, as the Cafe has got plenty of options.</p><p>While they certainly serve the traditional Macaroni & Cheese, they also provide various different options for the price of $6.49 which includes a shrimp and sweet chilli sauce as well as a pulled pork option.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> The Highest-Grossing Live-Action Disney Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For those looking for quite a filling, and savoury snack, then this is certainly an option that you should look into, even if it is one of the pricier choices in Disney.</p><h2 id=funnel-cake-7-79>Funnel Cake ($7.79)</h2><p>This popular snack can be located in a couple of places in Disney World, such as the Sleepy Hollow inside the Magic Kingdom, as well as at the kiosk in the America pavilion of EPCOT's World Showcase.</p><p>The snack is sugary goodness at its best, with Funnel Cake being a classic American dessert that visitors from around the world particularly enjoy, often getting to try it for the first time in Disney.</p><p>This snack comes with a $7.79 price tag, but it is also loaded with whipped cream and strawberries (so you can at least be a little healthy) on top, making it fairly good value for your money.</p><h2 id=night-blossom-7-99>Night Blossom ($7.99)</h2><p>The Night Blossom drink is one of the newer snack options in Disney World and can be located from Pongu Pongu, inside the Pandora section of Animal Kingdom, and it is certainly an eye-catching option.</p><p>The drink is another incredibly refreshing option, with several different frozen flavors with the limeade having a mix of apple and pear within the drink, providing the different colors and flavors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As well as that, the drink is topped with passion fruit boba balls (which you can order without), making this an exciting and unique drink within the theme park, costing $7.99 for one.</p><h2 id=blue-green-milk-7-99>Blue/Green Milk ($7.99)</h2><p>Another brand new drink option at Disney World is the blue and green milk which is available in Hollywood Studios' Galaxy's Edge section, an immersive area that is dedicated to Star Wars.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Star Wars: Every Member Of The Dark Sides Net Worth, Ranked&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>With a ride that gives people the opportunity to fly the Millenium Falcon and a variety of characters from the film series walking around, the area has been a mega-hit with people, and that isn't the only way Disney has immersed guests.</p><p>Disney has created some incredible food and beverage options, with one snack being the popular green and blue milk, just like from the movies, with this being a major hit, although one glass will set you back $7.99.</p><h2 id=loaded-buffalo-chicken-tots-9-49>Loaded Buffalo Chicken Tots ($9.49)</h2><p>This is another example of quite an expensive snack, that some people may class as an entire meal, but is certainly easy enough to be split and enjoyed between meals to keep your energy high during a busy day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These can be located in the Magic Kingdom at The Friar's Nook, which used to be an area dedicated to Macaroni & Cheese, but was changed to focus on tots instead, with this particular option having buffalo chicken on top.</p><p>As well as that, there is a blue cheese dressing and celery, and it is certainly a filling option, although it can be quite spicy, which is always something to consider.</p><h2 id=jumbo-turkey-leg-11-75>Jumbo Turkey Leg ($11.75)</h2><p>Let's be honest, the Jumbo Turkey Leg really is not a 'snack,' as it is big enough to work as an entire meal if you wanted to with these legs being absolutely massive, yet because they have become so popular, many people treat them as snacks.</p><p>While many people speculate that they are not even Turkey, simply due to the size of them, but their popularity is incredible, with Disney <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly </a>selling 1.8 million pounds of these each year.</p><p>One Turkey Leg costs $11.75, which is very expensive for a snack, but as we pointed out, it is big enough to fill you as a meal, and therefore you can't really blame Disney for the price point on this one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a
