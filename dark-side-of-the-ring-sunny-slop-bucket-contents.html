<span>Patria Henriques</span></p><h1>Dark Side Of The Ring Hints At Contents Of Slop Bucket Dumped On Sunny</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong><a href=#>Dark Side of the Ring</a></strong> is officially back for season four, kicking off with an episode on Chris Candido and Tammy Sytch, the latter being better known as WWE's Sunny to a lot of wrestling fans. The bulk of the episode focused on Candido as members of his family and close friends from the industry spoke on his addiction and untimely death as he was on the road to recovery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-slop-bucket>The Slop Bucket</h2><p>Sytch could arguably have an episode of her own and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that's the plan for a future season. A number of elements from her career and life were touched upon though, and even though the bigger issues have come her way in later life, Jim Cornette discussed a certain incident in the locker room early in her career.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Dark Side Of The Ring Announces All 10 New Episodes For Season 4</a></span></p><p>Sytch wasn't well liked by her peers in WWE when she went by Sunny. Getting a lot of attention and TV time the second she stepped through the door, one night wrestlers were told The Godwins' signature slop bucket would be going over Sytch's head on TV that night. It was made clear, with a wink and a nudge, that the bucket would be left unattended and no one was to go anywhere near it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/collage-maker-31-may-2023-10-04-am-9828.jpg><h2 id=a-lot-of-stuff-in-that-bucket>A Lot Of Stuff In That Bucket</h2><p>Subtly prompted to relieve themselves in the bucket should they have a problem with Sytch, or simply if they thought the idea was funny, the bucket wound up being poured over Sytch's head on the show that night. Although it was planned and Sytch knew it was coming, I can't imagine she would have been aware of exactly what was in that bucket, and perhaps doesn't know to this day.</p><p>As noted, Candido's career was covered in-depth during the episode. On the road to recovery from addiction, Candido broke his ankle wrestling in TNA and developed a blood clot that would kill him after insisting he fly to a show just two days later. Cornette and others close to Candido struggled to hold back tears as they explained despite Sytch being the bigger star, his influence on the business is evident today whereas the era Sunny kicked off has been left in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeUlr%2BsedKim55ln5t6tbTEZqmippdiwLa6zbJkrKSfpXqjwcKknK1lk6S7tbHNrapo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./comfywithkerry-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-284009-html.html><span>←</span><span>Comfywithkerry Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
