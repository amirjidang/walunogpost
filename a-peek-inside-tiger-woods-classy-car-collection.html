During his 26-year professional career, with the backing of endorsements, appearances, and course designs, Woods has amassed a $1.7 billion net worth and has been the highest-paid athlete for many years on a stretch. He is in the same bracket as other <a href=#>greats athletes like Michael Jordan</a> and, most recently welcomed to the billionaire club, Lebron James. He also owns a $54 million estate on Jupiter Island, home to the super-rich and famous. To add to his extravagant estate, here are some classy rides in Tiger Woods' collection.</p><h2 id=cadillac-escalade>Cadillac Escalade</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From Justin Bieber to <a href=#>the multitalented Jennifer Lopez</a>, almost every celebrity in Hollywood has owned or currently owns their own luxurious Cadillac Escalade. The massive frame of the SUV causes it to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">often be used as a limousine by celebrities </a>when attending glamorous award shows and events, and that is due to its sleek, expensive look. And it's no slouch either! Backed by a 6.2-liter V8 engine, it can reach a max of 420 horsepower. Although Woods was more than likely driving an earlier version, his Escalade became infamously known after hitting a fire hydrant at his former Windermere Florida home in 2009. However, for an <a href=#>athlete as wealthy as Tiger Woods</a>, $150,000 is chump change if he wishes to add another Cadillac to his extensive car collection.</p><h2 id=lamborghini-murcielago>Lamborghini Murcielago</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sleek, sporty, and bursting with speed, the Lamborghini Murcielago is a classic model of its brand. Not to be mistaken with the pretty pink Lamborghini Gallardo Roadster owned by rapper Nicki Minaj, the Murcielago revs up a 6.5-liter V-12 engine that can jump to 100 km/h (62 mph) in just 3.2 seconds. The Lamborghini Gallardo carries a V-10 engine, so there's a slight difference in the engine, although the speed doesn't differ much. Telling from Woods' extravagant lifestyle of comfort, his purchase of the much smaller, less roomy Murcielago was uncharacteristic of his style and taste, but with other <a href=#>celebrities like Chris Brown</a>, Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian, and Pierce Brosnan owning one of these speed devils, he had to see what he hype was all about! Woods spent roughly $302,000 on the sports car.</p><h2 id=buick-bengal>Buick Bengal</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the Buick Bengal was made back in 2001, the company reportedly did so with Tiger Woods in mind. He has often been chosen by the company to be the face of many of their <a href=#>commercials and marketing promotions</a>, which is why he was gifted a concept car model by the company in 2001. Resembling your typical roadster, the Bengal is actually able to fit up to four passengers in total. Despite its classy and modern look with voice-activated control features, the Bengal only sports a supercharged 3.4-liter V-6 with a six-speed automatic transmission, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Car and Driver</a>. So it's not quite the high-performance sportscar that a <a href=#>Fast and Furious driver like Vin Diesel</a> would be caught cruising in.</p><h2 id=porsche-carrera-gt>Porsche Carrera GT</h2><p>Now here's a car that is only for the brave of heart due to its insane speed and overall performance. Listed as one of his more exclusive cars, and for good reason, Woods owns a Porsche Carrera GT that packs a serious punch on the road. There's a perfectly good reason this sports car is considered exclusive, seeing there are only 1270 vehicles in production. Weighing only 3000 pounds, the beautiful beast is backed by a 5.5-liter V10 engine. However, later models have been increased to a 5.7-liter engine, which boasts a top speed of 330 km/h or 205 mph, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official Porsche website</a>. Another celebrity who owns one of these monsters is the<a href=#> legendary comedian Jerry Seinfeld.</a> Woods reportedly paid between $625,000 to $1,250,000 for his special edition ride.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> A Peek Inside Michael Jordan's Car Collection&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2 id=buick-velite>Buick Velite</h2><p>Woods and Buick seem to have a special relationship where they constantly give him concept vehicles. After gifting him his first Buick Bengal in 2001, he was given another concept vehicle in the early 2000s, this time a 2004 Buick Velite. Similar to the first Buick concept car, this one also did not get a formal introduction to the road and is also a four-seat convertible, boasting a twin-turbocharged, intercooled 3.6-liter V-6 engine. Although this original model was not introduced onto the market in America, the Velite was <a href=#>introduced in China </a>at a car show, with changes to a few of the features, including making it electrically powered. There is no known price for the concept vehicle, although it is estimated to be between $25,000 and $28,000. Other celebrities who drive Buicks include Jay Leno, David Spade, and Brad Pitt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mercedes-benz-s65>Mercedes-Benz S65</h2><p>There are many celebrities who drive Mercedes-Benz, from Britney Spears and Kevin Hart to Drake and the<a href=#> comedy king Eddie Murphy</a>. However, none of them drives the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mercedes-Benz S65 </a>except for the most successful golf player in history, Tiger Woods. Embodying the epitome of luxurious style, class, and comfort while also promising a brute force of power that is unmatched in its class, the Mercedes-Benz S65 is a high-performance vehicle with a 6.0-liter V12 engine with an awesome 621 horsepower, ran by a nine-speed automatic transmission. This speed machine can dash from 0 to 60 MPH in just 3.0 seconds. If you're a<a href=#> billion-dollar professional athlete</a>, then this is a treat in your garage to the car collection.</p><h2 id=buick-enclave>Buick Enclave</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of Woods' longest-standing endorsement relationships was with the car company, Buick, and the Buick Enclave was another vehicle he was gifted. However, his sponsorship deal was discontinued when General Motors made substantial cuts in 2008. A few of his other sponsors and endorsements include Monster Energy Drink,&nbsp;<a href=#>the famous sports brand Nike</a>, 2K Gaming, and Golf TV. This time, the Buick SUV was the first of its kind, powered by a 275-horsepower V-6 engine with six-speed automatic transmission. This is uncharacteristic of a plus-sized vehicle, such as the Cadillac Escalade, which sports a V-8 engine. Woods paid roughly $35,000 for the 2008 Enclave.</p><h2 id=buick-lacrosse>Buick LaCrosse</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The only other athlete that tried to fit into a Buick LaCrosse was the <a href=#>renowned Basketball superstar, Shaquille O'Neal</a>, and even that was a daunting task! Apparently, Woods was back on the sponsorship list with Buick even after it was announced that he would be dropped. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Sun</a>, Tiger advertised for the car business four years after he was cut from the brand. The 2012 Buick LaCrosse is spacious and luxurious with decent handling. The engine is a 2.4-liter four-cylinder base and has a top speed of 155 mph. After that model, the company stopped the production of the LaCrosse and focused on SUVs.</p><h2 id=lexus-ls460>Lexus LS460</h2><p>A Lexus is another symbol of status and financial success that has become synonymous with the <a href=#>elite in Hollywood</a>, much like the Mercedes brand. And for a super-rich athlete like Tiger Woods, this vehicle only stands to compliment his already exceptional car collection. For an idea of how many celebrities are a part of the Lexus crew, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Club Lexus</a> lists John Legend, Reese Witherspoon, Gerard Butler, and<a href=#> the beautiful Halle Berry</a> to name a few. The luxury sports car boasts a V-8 engine 4.6-liter engine with an eight-speed automatic transmission standard. The Lexus LS460 probably cost the 46-year-old Golf champion roughly $93,700.00.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>A Peek Inside Tiger Woods' $54 Million Jupiter Island Estate</a></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Sun</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Car and Driver</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Porsche.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drive-My</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Bmp56dm2K2r7%2FInZxmrJmcsrN51qimnatdmLmiv9KyZJyZomKwsLjLnpqtoZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-pics-proving-katy-perry-isnt-that-attractive.html><span>←</span><span>15 Pics Proving Katy Perry Isn't That Attractive</span></a>
