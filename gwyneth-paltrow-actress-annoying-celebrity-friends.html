"I've known [Gwyneth] a long time. That woman has got style to the moon and back. Chic, effortless, gorgeous. This sums us up," the Friends alum shared, adding: "She's always been sweet to me." No wonder she was invited to the engagement party of the View From The Top actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-hudson><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Kate Hudson</span></h2><p>The two Hollywood blondes are not just BFFs; The Great Expectations actress considers the How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days star, “My little sister,” adding that "she radiates happiness and makes everything fun.” To prove it, the Fabletics co-founder appeared on the debut episode of the Goop Your Bar Cart series to share mixology tips and drunk stories.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos Of Gwyneth Paltrow That'll Make Her Ex, Chris Martin Miss Her</a></span></p><h2 id=ross-matthews><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ross Matthews</span></h2><p>Years ago, when&nbsp;the roly-poly, former Chelsea&nbsp;Lately comedian&nbsp;saw the Great Expectations actress pointed to his stomach and said, "'What's going on here? I love you. Get it together."

No one makes me laugh like you do,” said the Shallow Hal actress of her childhood friend, then added: “We used to be 17 but today...47.” Well, that happens.</p><h2 id=and-her-high-school-friends><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And Her High School Friends</span></h2><p>“The original six since 1985,” is how the Running With Scissors actress referred to this group. How many can say they still know people from when they were 13 or so? No wonder their smiles are genuine and there is an ease about them being together.</p><p>Something a lot of people would love to experience with GP but never will.
