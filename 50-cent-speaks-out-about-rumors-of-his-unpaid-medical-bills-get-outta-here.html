He owns a series of businesses, has made a huge footprint in the world of music, and has even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released a self-help book which helps guide people out of difficult situations.</a></p><p>Interestingly, he has found himself in a tough situation now. His worldwide fans know that 50 Cent was famously shot 9 times and that made a shocking full recovery. What they may not know until just now, is the fact that the doctors claim he walked away without paying that life-saving medical bill.</p><p>So what does 50 Cent have to say about that? He says; "Get the F*#@ Outta Here"</p><h2 id=50-cent-won-t-cough-up>50 Cent Won't Cough Up</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are two sides to every story, and in this case, these two sides are very divided. Curtis Jackson, aka 50 Cent is not even willing to give any attention to this doctor's requests. He's simply not paying the bill. He's making it seem as though the doctor is coming after him for his wealth and not to collect a legitimate bill that was outstanding. The doctor,&nbsp;Dr. Nader Paksima, claims that he performed life-saving measures to 50 Cent during the time that he required emergency treatment, and he claims that the rapper has the means to pay the bill, yet refuses to do so.</p><p>He simply won't cough it up, and the doctor has grown tired of waiting and asking nicely. Paksima has filed a lawsuit, citing unpaid legal bills and a claim worth just over $32, 000.&nbsp; Paksima's legal team went on record to state that; "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“My client provided very good medical care</a> and [50 Cent] is in a position to pay for a very valuable service … He made a very nice recovery.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent Exploits Dr. Dre's Divorce Drama To Sell Copies Of His Book</a></span></p><h2 id=50-cent-blocks-fan-feedback>50 Cent Blocks Fan Feedback</h2><p>Now that we understand both sides of the story, we can add one interesting layer to the mix, and it doesn't seem to bode well for 50 Cent. In a bold and highly suspicious move, 50 Cent turned off the comments for this tweet. He seems to be broadcasting his views and then just closing this topic right off.</p><p>Could it possibly be true that 50 Cent bailed on the medical tab that saved his life, or is this claim so outrageous that he won't honor it with a discussion?</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Sneak Peek At 50 Cent's Promotional Video For His Book 'Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhsaWWTmru1edKpnJqjo2K8tsCMmpmoraRiv7a5zquqZqeWYrWqv4yupamZmZl6rrHDopqapF2Xtq240maenqxdpMK1wMBmn56qlWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-chilling-details-about-cathy-krausenecks-murder-550651-html.html><span>←</span><span>5 chilling details about Cathy Krausenecks murder</span></a>
