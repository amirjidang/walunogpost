And hey, maybe it’s time to take the</span><i> AHS</i><span> action outside! After spending so much time hanging out in murder houses or checking into haunted hotels, we could all do with a little fresh air.</span></p><p><span>Of course, it’s also possible that this is just the latest red herring by FX and its wildly creative marketing department — and that “The Mist” is just a cover from whence the real theme will emerge on September 14.</span></p><p>An FX rep declined to comment about the new season.&nbsp;</p><p>Tell <i>Us</i>: Are you excited for a season called<i> </i>“The Mist”?</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>American Horror Story </i>returns to FX Wednesday, September 14, at 10 p.m. ET. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJimnaKesKK6jKGmq6qfp3q0wM6rsGarlZbAsLqMb2StoJWism65wLJkoZmmmnqjscSnZKudppqurbHDZq5ta2dufXd7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yacov-yehuda-kat-grahams-half-brother-has-a-jewish-faith-404233-html.html><span>←</span><span>Yacov Yehuda Kat Grahams Half Brother Has A Jewish Faith</span></a>
