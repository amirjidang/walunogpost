This resulted in Hill hitting a tree.</p><p>The officer then proceeded inside his house to retrieve his gun and handcuffs while Hill followed behind him. Upon exiting, the officer directed Hill to lay on the ground but he refused, resulting in Hill driving forward again towards the officer, who fired multiple shots into the Jeep.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, none of them hit their target and it was enough to stop him from moving further. The officer, along with a witness, were able to detain Hill until other officers arrived, later on, to take him into custody.</p><p>As a result of this incident, Hill has been charged with attempted murder and is currently being held in Morgan County Jail with a cash bond of $1 million dollars in place if he is released on bail.</p><p>It’s also noted that he will have to be supervised by pre-trial supervisors; no alcohol or firearms are permitted within his home or vehicles, nor any communication with the victim.</p><p>The incident was captured on doorbell camera footage showing Brown retreating inside his home while being chased by Hill as soon as he exited again armed with his weapon – this being what led up to the gunshots being discharged moments after.</p><p>Brown himself had only minor injuries, which were treated upon arrival at Huntsville Hospital before being released later that night.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCty5qZmqWRYrynsoydrK2xXZi8sXnArauepaCpwG7AzmabnqyRnrtuv9Ssp56bpGK0psDSZqmupl2kw6a%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adhir-kalyan-and-wife-emily-wilson-are-neighbors-to-property-brothers-what-fun-506950-html.html><span>←</span><span>Adhir Kalyan and Wife Emily Wilson Are Neighbors To Property Brothers, What Fun!</span></a>
