We'll take a look at why Sandler loves using this formula and why he did so for Grown Ups.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-sandler-wrote-grown-ups-with-the-cast-of-his-friends-already-in-mind>Adam Sandler Wrote Grown Ups With The Cast Of His Friends Already In Mind</h2><p>Yes, it was the plan from the start, as Adam Sandler revealed in his interview with Collider. While writing the movie Grown Ups, <a href=#>the actor already envisioned the top tier cast.</a></p><p>"Yes, I did. Me and Fred Wolf wrote the movie. The whole idea was about putting together old friends that get to hang out for a weekend. These guys are my old friends, so it made total sense. I’m glad they said yes to it."</p><p>Given such a talented cast, Sandler admitted that a lot of unscripted lines went into the film. "There was a lot of ad-libbing and a lot of jokes. I wasn’t shocked by anybody, but everybody who watches the movie loves Spade. I think they’re used to every one of us doing good work and not used to David doing anything good."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Much Money Did Adam Sandler Pay Halsey To Perform At His Daughter's Bat Mitzvah?</a></span></p><p>Salma Hayek was the only star cast to the film to play a major role who hadn't appeared alongside Sandler in the past. Though Adam did admit they came close to working together a few times.</p><p>"We talked about doing a movie for a long time. Salma was available. She almost was in Zohan. She almost was in a bunch of movies, but they didn’t time out right. This one timed out great. It was fun being married to Salma, in the movie. She’s a great girl."</p><p>It all came together for Sandler and according to David Spade, the casting of his close Hollywood friends took place for a very specific reason.</p><h2 id=david-spade-revealed-that-sandler-picked-his-hollywood-friends-to-create-a-golden-state-warriors-type-feel>David Spade Revealed That Sandler Picked His Hollywood Friends To Create A Golden State Warriors Type Feel</h2><p>Given that Adam loves his basketball, it is only fitting that his goal was to mimic the Golden State Warriors for the Grown Ups film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to David Spade, <a href=#>Sandler's plan was to take the best comedy acts in Hollywood</a> and include them in the film - similar to what the Golden State Warriors did with some of the top players in the league.</p><p>"He assembled a team like the Golden State Warriors. Get guys that have their own movies and we’ll all be in one when there’s a lot of competition,” Spade explained. “It was a good trick. And when we shot it, he spread out the jokes, so we all got to score.”</p><p>“We all write jokes for him,” the actor added. “That movie was like good, family, not-dirty, funny movie. And the second one, too.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Adam Sandler's Wife Jackie Likes It When He Kisses Famous Women</a></span></p><p>Spade and the others had a great time shooting the film and of course, he's open to more in the future.</p><h2 id=grown-ups-was-yet-another-adam-sandler-film-with-basketball-involved>Grown Ups Was Yet Another Adam Sandler Film With Basketball Involved</h2><p>Adam Sandler is enjoying huge success at the moment thanks to his Netflix film Hustle. In truth, it isn't the first time he uses basketball as inspiration for a script. In fact, he did exactly that for Grown Ups as well.</p><p>"I grew up playing church league basketball. It was a big part of my town. I thought that, instead of doing a movie about high school, it would be easier if we made it church league basketball kids. That way, when you see them in the past, it’s easier to buy little kids as us, instead of high school kids."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Sixth grade was a big time, in my childhood, of hoops and friendship, and coming up with funny things. That’s what the movie is. Our kids are that age. We thought that that’s when it starts. You see the contrast of childhood now, compared to what we were like as kids. So, that’s why I picked the 12-year-old basketball thing. That was a big part of my life. The cast all play a little bit of ball, so we just thought that would be interesting."</p><p>Yes, Sandler has earned the right to touch on things he truly loves, like basketball and working with his friends.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Adam Sandler's Biggest Box Office Hit Caught Fans By Surprise</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecCdmKZlo5a7pbjEq2ScmaOpeqm10mafqKScrsSwu8NmnauhlaOxtHnFqKlmn6KkxK951KmqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-tammy-sepetis-on-tiktok-hr-recruiter-from-burlington-canada-went-viral-318320-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Tammy Sepetis On TikTok?
