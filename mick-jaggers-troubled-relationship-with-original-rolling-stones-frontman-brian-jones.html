Known for their longevity, the Rolling Stones are rightfully one of the most beloved rock 'n' roll groups in history. From smash hits such as "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", "Paint It Black", "Gimme Shelter", and "Jumpin' Jack Flash" to impressive live performances, the iconic group has stood the test of time.</p><p>While lead singer Mick Jagger is often regarded as the face of the Rolling Stones, he was not the original leader of the group in their earliest days. That distinction belongs to Brian Jones, who tragically passed away in 1969. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jones and Jagger had an interesting relationship </a>during a key transitional period in the band's history. Jones was eventually fired by the band he founded and Jagger took a more prominent role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-was-mick-jagger-and-brian-jones-39-relationship-complicated>How Was Mick Jagger And Brian Jones' Relationship Complicated?</h2><p>Brian Jones, the founder and original rhythm guitarist of The Rolling Stones, was by all means a complex figure in music history. Known for his strong personality, Jones was a proud individual who liked control. Furthermore, he desired credit even if he did not deserve it, according to Express. It was <strong>Jones' ego that perhaps played the most critical role</strong> in his eventual downfall and demise.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/the-one-song-the-rolling-stones-won-t-ever-play-again-commons-licenses.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The One Song The Rolling Stones Won't Ever Play Again">The One Song The Rolling Stones Won't Ever Play Again</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>This one song from The Rolling Stones spared so much controversy that the band agreed never to play it again.</p><p>The Rolling Stones were nurturing their growing fan base in the era of groups such as The Beatles. In an effort to broaden their audience, new management was hired. Consequentially, The Rolling Stones' management recognized original music was key to the band's long-term success. Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards began to develop a songwriting partnership that resulted in massive hits for the group. Jagger and Richards' legendary partnership did not come without turmoil, however. A <a href=# rel=nofollow>massive feud </a>resulted in some of their best songs. As Jagger and Richards took more responsibility in the group, this frustrated an egotistical Jones. Even worse, the band's management reorganized the band's hierarchy so that Jones would have a smaller role, according to Grunge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jones wanted to<strong> take credit for the band's success</strong>, even though his role was becoming more limited. Mick Jagger spoke candidly about Jones's behavior in an interview: "He was very musical, so he could pick up different instruments, and he was quite innovative, so a lot of his contributions were perhaps not for melodies and lyrics but from licks that he played. Yeah, he liked to tell people it was his band, but we were always like 'Really? What do you mean it's your band?' We thought it was our band, not Brian's."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/keith-richards.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Rolling Stones Guitarist Keith Richards Had A Near-Death Experience On Stage">Rolling Stones Guitarist Keith Richards Had A Near-Death Experience On Stage</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Keith Richards survived one of the scariest moments in rock history.</p><p>Despite trying to take credit for the Rolling Stones' fame, Jones began to dislike the band's artistic direction under Jagger and Richards, according to Ultimate Guitar.com. Furthermore, not only was Jones a difficult team player, but his <strong>controversial personal habits began to interfere </strong>with the band's work. Jones had a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">profound substance addiction</a>, and his challenges became hard for fellow band members to handle. The former leader had multiple drug possession arrests and his "habit led to increasing unreliability", according to Grunge. Jones's habits became so detrimental that his criminal actions prevented him from touring with the Rolling Stones overseas in the US.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mick-jagger-and-brian-jones-deposit.jpg><p>Jones also had a strong opinion on Jagger's eccentric personality and fashion as well. As the band began to explore more vibrant fashion trends, this angered Jones, who had a conservative view on masculinity, according to Express. According to Jagger in an interview,</p><p>"I remember Brian being rather critical of me once because he thought I was too feminine."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of Jones' behavior, The Rolling Stones decided to release him from the band in June 1969. Jagger and Richards personally visited Jones and told him that he was fired and that The Rolling Stones would continue to perform and record new music without him. Out of respect for Jones, Jagger and Richards gave him the option to publicly resign from the band. Jones chose to resign, and told fans and the media that he ended his relationship with The Rolling Stones due to artistic motives. Jones' days were, unfortunately, numbered by the time that he was released from The Rolling Stones. Less than a month later, he was found lifeless at his home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rolling-stones-jacket-amsterdam-deposit.jpg><p>Jones was not the only member of The Rolling Stones to pass away. The band would later lose drummer, Charlie Watts, in 2021, and Jagger and Richards <a href=# rel=nofollow>shared fond words</a> about their time with Watts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-brian-jones-pass-away>How Did Brian Jones Pass Away?</h2><p>Brian Jones started a<strong> tragic trend in music history</strong>. He passed away at 27 years old, and other notable names soon followed, including Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and Jim Morrison. The 27 Club is notorious and Jones was the first member, according to Grunge.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-rolling-stones.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Rolling Stones Aren't The Only Iconic Band To Have Their Songs Sued For Copyright Infringement">The Rolling Stones Aren't The Only Iconic Band To Have Their Songs Sued For Copyright Infringement</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The Rolling Stones may be the latest big-name musician to face a copyright infringement lawsuit, but they're certainly not alone...</p><p>After being released from the Rolling Stones, Jones' dangerous substance abuse habits only increased. His <strong>life spiraled out of control</strong>. According to former Rolling Stones member Bill Wyman, "he inadvertently made the wrong decisions, to his detriment."</p><p>On July 3rd, 1969, Jones was found in his pool unresponsive. The founder of the Rolling Stones, one of the most celebrated bands of its era, had drowned. An autopsy confirmed that Jones's substance habits negatively impacted his health. Doctors discovered Jones had severe liver complications. Furthermore, a <strong>cocktail of substances was found </strong>in Jones' system at the time of his death, according to Grunge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rolling-stones-concert-johan-cruijff-arena-july-2022-deposit-1.jpg><p>Jones was only a young man when he passed away, and could have had an incredible future ahead of him. Perhaps he would have even reunited with the legendary band he started. While fans will never know what could have been, Jones's passing was felt. More than 50 years after his death, Brian Jones is still remembered and honored as a key figure in rock 'n' roll history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopubYreis8aeqaxlpKe8tq7LnptmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYsSqwMdmpquhl567oriMq6alpJmjtG6%2F06ilnqtdm7%2BwutOmmKdlkqe2orqMo6annaNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-tall-is-james-wilkie-broderick-height-and-age-find-sarah-jessica-parker-son-on-instagram-2.html><span>←</span><span>How Tall Is James Wilkie Broderick?
