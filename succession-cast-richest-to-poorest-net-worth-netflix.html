The impressive fit attained by the show led to the filming of a new season that involves new characters, as well as new plots in the Roy household. In addition to putting some of its cast members on the map, Succession also made multimillionaires out of them. Here are some of the richest cast members of the show.</p><h2 id=brian-cox---15-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Brian Cox - $15 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Playing the role of Logan Roy, the Roy family patriarch and the founder of Waystar Royco is Scottish actor, Brian Cox.

Soon after, word of his talent spread throughout Hollywood which helped him land roles in a lot of movies and television series such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Cooper Barrett's Guide to Surviving Life, From the Earth to the Moon, and Sierra Burgess Is a Loser. Ruck is also one of the highest-paid cast members of Succession and has been able to amass an estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> of $10 million from his acting career.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of ‘You' Season 3 Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></span></p><h2 id=fisher-stevens---8-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Fisher Stevens - $8 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fisher Stevens landed his first role at the age of 16 in a horror film called The Burning.
