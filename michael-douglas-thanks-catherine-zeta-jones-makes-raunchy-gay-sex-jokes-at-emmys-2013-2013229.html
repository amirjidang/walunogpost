Winning his Best Actor in a TV-Movie or Miniseries for his role in Behind the Candelabra, the 68-actor was in a jubilant, playful mood. “Thank you my academy, fellow members, thank you so much and to the great performances by all the other nominees,” Douglas began, acknowledging his competitors <strong>Toby Jones, Benedict Cumberbatch</strong> and <strong>Al Pacino.</strong> “But obviously there’s one nominee in particular that I have to really thank: Matt.”</p><p>That would be <a href=#><strong>Matt Damon,</strong></a> his costar in the acclaimed HBO <strong>Liberace</strong> biopic, in which Douglas played the beloved pianist opposite Damon, taking on the role of Liberace’s lover, Scott Thorson. “This is a two-hander, and you’re only as good as your other hand,” said Douglas as the camera panned to Damon — who instantly blushed and giggled. (Damon and Douglas didn’t flinch filming frank scenes of gay sex in the film.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“You were magnificent,” Douglas raved to a smiling Damon, 40. “And the only reason i’m standing her is because you. so you really deserve half of this. So, you want the bottom or the top?” he added to more audience titters.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Another surprise during the speech? The cancer survivor thanked wife <a href=#><strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones</strong></a> who was not in attendance for the event; the spouses of 13 years announced their <a href=#>separation</a> over the summer. “I wanna thank my wife Catherine for her support, my kids Dylan (13) and Carys (10).” He also gave “a shout out for my eldest son Cameron.” Cameron, the star’s 35-year-old son from a previous marriage, is currently serving a 10-year sentence in prison on drug charges. “I’m hoping I’ll be able to — [they’ll] allow me to see him soon.”</p><p>Watch Douglas make Damon blush now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSim5iWsq15w6isoKSRqHq1tMCnoqxlk5bBqbHRoqWeZaqawaJ5yailnqtdoq6ssdJmqZqtnpi1unnGmrBmq5Wtequ7yp6qZpmkYrKuudisZGtoYWh6c3yQbGlrcV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-b-jordan-sparks-dating-rumors-with-musician-snoh-aalegra.html><span>←</span><span>Michael B.
