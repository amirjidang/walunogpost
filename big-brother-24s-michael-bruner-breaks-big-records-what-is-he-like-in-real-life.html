The reality TV show which began with 16 house guests is now down to 5 contestants, with viewers eager for their favorite houseguest to walk home with the $750,000 grand prize. That the show has been full of suspense, shocking turns, and betrayals would be putting it mildly. One of these unexpected turns was the elimination of BB24 alum Michael Bruner in the ninth week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# title="What Big Brother 24's Taylor Hale Is Like In Real Life">What Big Brother 24's Taylor Hale Is Like In Real Life</a></span></p><p>Bruner, who was a major contender, had a stellar outing in the <strong><a href=#>Big Brother</a></strong> 24 house. With six <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Power of Veto wins</a>, it is only fitting to refer to Bruner as the “Veto King.” The Minnesota native broke Janelle Pierzina's 16-year record of five while matching her number of total combined wins on the show. During his time in the house, Bruner expressed qualities in leadership, competitiveness, and strategic thinking, making fans wonder what he is like in real life.</p><h2 id=michael-bruner-s-job-in-real-life><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Michael Bruner's Job In Real Life</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the show, the BB24 alum was known for his ability to strategize and manipulate as long as it was within the confines of the game. This did not come as a surprise, given that Michael Bruner is an attorney. He attended Mitchell Hamline School of Law and graduated in October 2020. After graduation, Bruner worked briefly as an associate attorney before moving to Cooper Law, LLC where he worked until becoming a <a href=#>Big Brother 24 houseguest</a>.</p><h2 id=michael-bruner-loves-animals><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Michael Bruner Loves Animals</span></h2><p>While many people are divided as to whether they prefer cats or dogs, Michael Bruner is happy being an all-around animal lover with an obvious preference for cats. A glance at his Instagram page reveals that he is the proud father of three cats named Lila, Meghan, and Sasha. While the BB24 alum is a proud cat dad, his love for animals is evident in his fondness for other animals and in his advocacy for animal rights.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-bruner-is-a-big-brother-superfan><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Michael Bruner Is A Big Brother Superfan</span></h2><p>For years, the BB24 houseguest was a superfan of the reality show, so being cast in the show was a dream come true. Although Michael Bruner won’t be advancing to the finale, being a superfan gave him an advantage in the house. He dominated the game, squelching every opposition against himself until he was evicted. The legendary player has also stated that if given the opportunity, he would like to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> return for an all-stars season.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Fans Think Big Brother Contestant Paloma Aguilar Left The Show For Breaking The Rules">Fans Think Big Brother Contestant Paloma Aguilar Left The Show For Breaking The Rules</a></span></p><h2 id=is-michael-bruner-dating-anyone><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Is Michael Bruner Dating Anyone?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michael Bruner is in love. The reality TV star is engaged to his best friend and longtime partner Hayden Middleton. The BB24 alum popped the big question in June before joining the show. In his engagement announcement, Bruner revealed that they had gotten a house in preparation for the next stage as couples.</p><p>In August, their relationship made headlines when Middleton’s letter was not given airtime prompting him to complain over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Brother’s LGBT snub.</a></p><h2 id=michael-bruner-loves-board-games><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Michael Bruner Loves Board Games</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The BB24 alum enjoys playing board games outside of work and his romantic relationship. A peep through his social media bios both read “lover of board games.” While in the house, Michael Bruner played a game of chess with Brittany, prompting his fiancé to make a post reminiscing about their weekend board game tournaments. The couple’s friends joined in the discussion, with one friend remarking that his absence from the tournament was the hardest thing about Bruner being in the house.</p><h2 id=michael-bruner-is-a-fierce-competitor><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Michael Bruner Is A Fierce Competitor</span></h2><p>The Big Brother franchise will not forget Michael Bruner in a hurry. The BB24 alum was all about making history while expressing his competitiveness. He recorded the fastest wins by any houseguest and holds the record for the only houseguest to complete a Trifecta Veto twice in any Big Brother season. Burners' competitive nature is known to his friends. Before appearing on the show, Burners' friends advised him to tone down his aggression and intensity during games, as this could be misinterpreted by viewers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# title="Julie Chen's All Time Favorite Big Brother Houseguests">Julie Chen's All Time Favorite Big Brother Houseguests</a></span></p><h2 id=where-is-michael-bruner-from><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Where Is Michael Bruner From?</span></h2><p>The Big Brother 24 houseguest was born and raised in Minnesota. The land of 10,000 lakes has been home to the attorney since birth. Michael Bruner had all his education from basic to advanced in the state. From all indications, it appears that the reality TV star has no plans of leaving Minnesota, as he and his fiancé acquired their first house together in the same state.</p><h2 id=michael-bruner-loves-his-privacy><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Michael Bruner Loves His Privacy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reality TV and privacy aren’t exactly a great mix, but Michael Bruner may have cracked the code to being in the limelight and maintaining a certain level of privacy. Before joining the show, the BB24 alum shared only the barest minimum about his life online. With Burners' newly found fame, it is not clear if the reality star will continue in his old ways or loosen up on sharing on social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZop9dl7%2BwwMeeqWZqZKh6rrXCoZiepF2Xv7a6xKtkm6qVlri0ecGinmaqlZi8s7DSZq6hmaRitrR5x55kpaGbmnqquoyrnJqkXaG2p7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bianca-censori-small-fortune-barely-there-outfits-kanye-rebounds-near-bankruptcy.html><span>←</span><span>Bianca Censori Drops Small Fortune On Barely-There Outfits As Kanye Rebounds From Near-Bankruptcy</span></a>
