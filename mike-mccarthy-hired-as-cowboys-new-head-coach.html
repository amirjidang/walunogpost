ESPN's Todd Archer added that the deal was for five years.</p><p>McCarthy is the ninth head coach in Cowboys history.</p><p>The 56-year-old was head coach of the Green Bay Packers from 2006 to 2018, compiling a superb 125-77-2 record. McCarthy's tenure in Green Bay was highlighted by a Super Bowl XLV championship, where they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in Dallas, the site of McCarthy's new home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McCarthy led the Packers to six NFC North division titles during his 13-year tenure (2007, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016), and they reached four NFC Championship Games -- in 2007, 2010, 2014 and 2016.</p><p>But McCarthy's offense quickly dried up in Green Bay, and quarterback Aaron Rodgers began to struggle after his 2014 MVP season. The Packers fired McCarthy with four games to go in 2018, and they hired Matt LaFleur as their new head coach.</p><p>Green Bay rebounded with a 13-win season and the No. 2 seed in the NFC. They host the Seattle Seahawks this Sunday in the NFC Divisional Round.</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dallas Cowboys Are Parting Ways With Head Coach Jason Garrett [Rumor]</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McCarthy replaces Garrett, whom the Cowboys decided not to bring back after nine and a half seasons on the job. Garrett took over as interim head coach in 2010, and the majority of NFL fans and pundits remain surprised that he lasted this long.</p><p>Garrett finished with an 85-67 record in Dallas, but they only won two playoff games and never once got to the NFC Championship Game under his watch. Owner Jerry Jones simply decided that it was time for change after a disappointing 8-8 season that saw Dallas miss the postseason for the third time in five years.</p><p>Time will tell how McCarthy pans out in Green Bay, but he has the championship experience and winning pedigree that should excite Cowboy fans. He's also joining a club that has more Pro Bowl and superstar talent than any team he had in Green Bay.</p><p><strong>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>NFL: The 10 Highest Paid Running Backs For 2019</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6topZmgsm65wpyYq6yYrnqptdGem2aZo2KwsMPBqLCsZZ6axG60xJqbZpuflrCpew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corinne-joy-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-198077-html.html><span>←</span><span>Corinne Joy Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
