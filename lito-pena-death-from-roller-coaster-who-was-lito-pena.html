He died on February 14, 2009.</p><p>To point out, Pena tumbled down from a ride called <strong>Star Flyer</strong> at the Star City complex in Pasay City. He was immediately taken to the San Huan de Dios Hospital after the incident.</p><p>But Lito could not make it to the hospital alive. He was declared dead as soon as he arrived there.</p><p>Actually, Pena had fallen in the afternoon at around 4 pm. On the other hand, some claimed he had passed away on the spot, not on his way to the hospital.</p><p>Likewise, the Star Flyer had reportedly taken over the expense for Pena as revealed by an operating officer. But not much is known about how the case developed after that.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>3. Lito Pena<br>Was a 39-year-old man who fell off an inverted Roller coaster and died on the spot.

Some even suggested his accident was impossible.</p><p>Pena had fallen off the ride as it was in an inverted position. The lock of his seat could not hold intact causing him to drop off.</p><p>But a spokesperson of the facility named Ed de Leon claimed that the accident was virtually impractical.</p><p>As a matter of fact, it was found that the locks of the seats in the ride were locked by a computerized mechanism. In addition, Pena’s seat was locked even after the accident happened.</p><p>Investigators were trying their best to find out the actual cause of his unfortunate accident. But no updates about the case are available even after almost a decade.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-was-lito-pena></span>Who Was Lito Pena?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lito Pena was studying in Rizal at the time he died. He was <strong>39 years old</strong> when he passed away.</p><p>Pena was from Binangonan, a municipality in the Philippines. It is not clear if he was born and raised there.</p><p>On the other hand, Pena’s professional background still remains a mystery. We are clueless about what job he had.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=know-lito-pena-wife-and-family></span>Know Lito Pena Wife and Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lito Pena’s wife has not surfaced the media yet. Also, we are not aware if he was married or not.</p><p>Pena’s family could file charges against the Star Flyer management. But they never revealed if they took any legal actions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKSZqbxuvMSnmGaclZbBqXnFq6amZaKkua2x0WaaqJmjqbKzedahpmavkah6rbXTqGSpnZ6WfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lindsay-usich-story.html><span>←</span><span>Lindsay Usich: Marilyn Mansons Wife and What is Known About Her</span></a>
