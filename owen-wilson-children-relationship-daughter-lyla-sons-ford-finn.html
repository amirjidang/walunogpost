Although he is most recognized for his work in high-profile comedies, he has also made a name for himself in rom-coms and dramas. Wilson's early career began with small roles in films such as Bottle Rocket and The Cable Guy, but it wasn't until his breakout performance in the hit comedy Zoolander that he became a household name. Since then, he has starred in a variety of films, from the family-friendly Night at the Museum franchise to the darkly comedic Inherent Vice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>The Truth About Owen Wilson’s Relationship With His Son, Finn Lindqvist Wilson</a></span></p><p>Recently, Wilson debuted in the film Paint as a Bob Ross-inspired character, once again leaving audiences excited to see what other memorable performances he will bring in the future. Despite his success, Wilson has remained grounded and is known for his easy-going personality both on and off-screen. His relationship with his children, though, has fallen under scrutiny.</p><h2 id=how-many-kids-does-owen-wilson-have>How Many Kids Does Owen Wilson Have?</h2><p>Owen Wilson, a widely recognized bachelor in Hollywood, has three children. Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he is not romantically involved with any of his children's mothers</a>, Wilson maintains a close relationship with his two sons, Ford and Finn. Ford was born in 2011 to Jade Duell, while Finn was born three years later to fitness professional Caroline Lindqvist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/owen-wilson-signing-autographs.jpg><p>Then, according to People, in 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wilson welcomed his third child, Lyla, with Varunie Vongsvirates</a>. Despite the unconventional family dynamic, Wilson revealed in an interview with Esquire that he and his children's mothers have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a good relationship and everyone gets along well.</a></p><h2 id=does-owen-wilson-see-his-sons>Does Owen Wilson See His Sons?</h2><p>Actor Owen Wilson has a strong bond with his two sons, 12-year-old Robert Ford (known as Ford) and 9-year-old Finn. Wilson has spoken openly in interviews about how much he values his role as a father and treasures his relationship with his children. It's clear that Wilson takes his parenting responsibilities seriously and is dedicated to being a loving and supportive dad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/owen-wilson-with-a-huge-smile.jpg><p>Although Owen Wilson and the mothers of the two boys make every effort to keep them out of the spotlight, numerous pictures of Wilson and the boys engaging in various activities together have been taken over the years.</p><h2 id=what-happened-with-owen-wilson-and-his-daughter>What Happened With Owen Wilson And His Daughter?</h2><p>Despite his financial support, Owen Wilson has been noticeably absent from his daughter's life, leaving many to wonder why. The Internet is awash with theories as to why the actor seems to have a problem connecting with Lyla. While some speculate that Wilson's busy work schedule may be to blame, others suggest that there may be deeper personal issues at play. Whatever the reason, it is clear that Wilson's absence has left a void in his daughter's life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/has-owen-wilson-lost-his-fanbase-after-it-came-out-that-he-refuses-to-have-a-relationship-with-his-daughter-lyla_.jpg><p>Due to Wilson's growing love and respect for his sons, Varunie finds it challenging to remain a distant observer anymore. Despite dating for five years, Varunie and Wilson have lost touch entirely, leading to Owen not communicating with their daughter. Speculations arise amongst fans; some believe that Varunie intentionally got pregnant without his knowledge, knowing full well he did not want any more children. Others suggest that she was trying to force him into marriage; however, even if they did not tie the knot, he would be equally involved in Lyla's life as he is with his sons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Varunie has made her battle to get Owen Wilson to meet his daughter very much public knowledge, which in turn has led to his mental health battles coming back as a topic of concern for many individuals. The actor has<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> struggled with depression for years, and in 2007 attempted to take his own life.</a> Although briefly mentioned at the time, this information has been kept hidden from the public eye.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Is There More To The Story Of Owen Wilson's Daughter?</a></span></p><p>Whatever the reasoning behind all of this is, we would like to think that there is a solid reason for it, whether his fans think his reason is valid isn’t really up for debate. He has always been private about his life and is remaining quiet about this topic as well, we have to respect that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-next-for-owen-wilson>What Is Next For Owen Wilson?</h2><p>As mentioned, Owen Wilson took on a new role in his latest film, Paint, as a public television painter named Carl Nargle. His character boasts a unique signature look with his perm hairstyle and customized van and has gained a loyal following of fans who closely watch his brushstrokes. However, when a younger and more talented artist takes everything and everyone that Carl loves, he is forced to confront the reality that there is more to life than ratings on television. Written and directed by Brit McAdams, Paint is a humorous portrayal of the cutthroat world of two artists vying for the title of the next Bob Ross on television.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Owen-Wilson-Feature-Image.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, coming soon Disney's famous Haunted Mansion attraction is getting a live-action adaptation, with Owen Wilson set to star as the leading role.
