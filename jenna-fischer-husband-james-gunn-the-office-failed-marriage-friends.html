Very easily, things can go the other way following a failed marriage. For <a href=#>Jenna Fischer</a> and <a href=#>James Gunn</a>, although things did not work in terms of their marriage, they managed to stay close till this very day!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jenna Fischer Auditioned For 'The Office' Alongside This Iconic Actor Who Was Almost Cast As Michael Scott</a></span></p><p>We'll take a look at what their current friendship is like and how they managed to find love along the way, moving on from their past.</p><p>In addition, we'll take a look at how both '<a href=#>The Office</a>' and 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' helped out in smoothening things over once they decided to move on. In fact, Fischer got some love advice from an unlikely source.</p><p>We'll delve into that along with so much more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fischer-got-some-good-advice-from-an-39-office-39-cast-member>Fischer Got Some Good Advice From An 'Office' Cast Member</h2><p>Going through a breakup is not easy, especially after a long-term relationship. Jenna Fischer was quick to learn all about that. She assumed many dates would take place instantly, however, it was very much the opposite as she reverted back to her college routines, spending nights alone at home.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>What Happened Between Jenna Fischer And First Husband James Gunn?</a></span></p><p>The sitcom star did admit to having some short-lived flings, though she knew it wouldn't lead to anything serious.</p><p>It was advice from a certain <a href=#>'The Office' co-star that really helped change her perspective</a>. It came from none other than Paul Lieberstein, aka Toby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“After my divorce, someone said to me, ‘Finding love is not as hard as picking the right person to spend the rest of your life with. I held on to that advice when I was searching.”</p><p>“I’d start to fall for someone and think, ‘But that’s not a good match. The fluttery feelings aren’t enough. When I was younger, I thought you married the person you fell in love with the most. But as [my ex-husband and I] learned what we wanted, I realized there was a whole other set of criteria. You have to ask, ‘Do we have the same goals?"</p><p>It would all work out ultimately for Jenna Fischer, as she met the love of her life, Lee Kirk. The two got hitched back in 2010 and have started a family since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for James Gunn, he went through his own struggles behind the scenes.</p><h2 id=gunn-compared-the-breakup-to-39-guardians-of-the-galaxy-39>Gunn Compared The Breakup To 'Guardians Of The Galaxy'</h2><p>When controversy started to take place between James Gunn and Disney, the filmmaker couldn't help but to be reminded of his former relationship alongside Jenna.</p><p>According to Gunn, <a href=#>keeping things amicable was necessary</a>, especially given the impact the two had on each other's lives.</p><p>"It was like the breakup of my marriage," he said. "I got divorced, and then had those conversations with my ex-wife: 'Let's get along as well as we possibly can and be kind to each other because we're both a large part of each other's lives."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>‘Guardians Of The Galaxy’ Writer James Gunn Says Gamora’s Death Wasn’t Planned</a></span></p><p>"But I would hate to look back on the six years that my wife and I were together and think, Oh, what a waste of time. Instead, I think it was a time when I really grew a lot and we were really good to each other. There were some problems, and we just weren't supposed to be married, but it was well worth living that six years with my ex."</p><p>Unlike Jenna, at this point, Gunn decided not to remarry. However, he is very happy currently alongside his partner, actress Jennifer Holland.</p><p>Surely, he learned a lot from his prior relationship and as it turns out, the two are still on great terms these days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-two-are-still-close>The Two Are Still Close</h2><p>It is refreshing to see a Hollywood couple keep things on good terms, despite a breakup. It wasn't all talk from both sides, as of 2021, they are still very much involved in one another's lives.</p><p>A few months back, Gunn took to Twitter, encouraging his followers to given a listen to Jenna's new podcast.</p><p>Jenna would even take the time and respond to the tweet, writing, "I can’t believe he’s animated! So fun. Love that pup."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things are clearly great between the two, more than a decade after they decided to go their own ways.</p><p>It'll be interesting to see if they end up crossing paths together again at some point, working on a new project together.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Jenna Fischer's Worth $16 Million: How The Office Star Amassed Her Wealth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaelnqntdKcn56qXZ3CtK7Ap5tmopGisrR5xq6lp2WknbJuu8WfoJydXZuuqrjEnWSmmaKntqKzxGadq6GVo7G0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./flamed-out-heres-why-fantastic-four-3-never-happened.html><span>←</span><span>Heres Why Fantastic Four 3 Never Happened</span></a>
