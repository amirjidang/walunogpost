The disco-gimmicked wrestler would occasionally defeat lower-level enhancement talent before putting over bigger stars. These days, Disco Inferno has become known for his <a href=#>controversial commentary</a> on modern wrestling.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things WCW Fans Should Know About Disco Inferno</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The biggest win of Disco Inferno's time in WCW came on an episode of Monday Night Nitro.

Horace is Hulk Hogan's legitimate nephew, During the 1990s, Horace wrestled for WWE, ECW, and WCW. Unlike his uncle, Horace was used as enhancement talent almost everywhere he wrestled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On an episode of Nitro, Horace was booked into a triple-threat match against Hulk Hogan and fellow New Blood member Billy Kidman. Horace largely remained away from the action, briefly teaming with Hogan against the interfering New Blood before hitting Hogan with a chair and pinning him for the win. The entire match <a href=#>was a mess</a>, but Horace Hogan still walked away with the win.</p><h2 id=la-parka-vs-juventud-guerrera><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>La Parka (Vs.

As a result, many talented wrestlers, including Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, Psicosis, Juventud Guerrera, and Konnan all wrestled for WCW. Many wrestlers that were signed by WCW were also used as enhancement talent, including La Parka.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While in WCW, La Parka would adopt the nickname of the Chairman of WCW, and would frequently bring a steel chair to the ring for his matches. Despite the advantage, La Parka still lost 60% of his matches. On his WCW Nitro debut, La Parka scored an upset victory over Juventud Guerrera, though.</p><h2 id=tex-slazenger-vs-brad-armstrong-and-marcus-bagwell><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tex Slazenger (Vs.

While many wrestling fans are unlikely to remember his time as Tex Slazenger, many wrestling fans will remember him as Phineas I. Godwinn, Mideon or Naked Mideon in WWE. In WCW, Slazenger stood in the ring with Sting, Randy Savage, and others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Early on in his time in WCW, Slazenger would team up with another wrestler named Shanghai Pierce, who would later wrestle as Henry O.

As a result, DeWane was mainly used to put over new wrestlers as they moved from the Power Plant and into WCW. DeWayne is also the person that reportedly told Batista that he <a href=#>would never make it in professional wrestling</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of DeWayne's last feuds on WCW television came when he teamed with Goldberg against the team of Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell.

While WWE frequently gave jobbers occupational gimmicks, like a racecar driver, garbageman, hockey player, and sports mascot, WCW had enhancement talent like the Gambler, a professional gambler, one of many <a href=#>terrible gimmicks</a> used by the promotion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Longest WCW Careers That Never Resulted In A Title Win</a></span></p><p>Jeff Gambol lost over 90% of his matches in WCW, putting over the likes of Dustin Rhodes, Sting, Lex Luger, Eddie Guerrero, and Chris Jericho.

The quintessential enhancement talent, Horowitz squared off against several high-profile wrestlers, all of whom he put over during his career. The <a href=#>most memorable</a> win in Horowitz's career came in WWE, after pulling off a shock-upset victory over BodyDonna Skip at SummerSlam 1995, no less!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite two separate stints in WCW, Horowitz only won four matches for the company, but one of those came against Barry Darsow.
