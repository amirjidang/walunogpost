The announcement came after two months of speculation surrounding the princess’ health following her successful abdominal surgery in January. Speculation about Kate’s condition and her eventual diagnosis were heavily covered by the BBC and other outlets.</p><p class=p1>“As part of our analysis, we examined the intense speculation there had been in the preceding weeks about the princess’s health,” the BBC statement continued. “We also reported on Catherine’s request for privacy and detailed the statement from Kensington Palace regarding the princess having the right to privacy in relation to her medical issues.”</p><p class=p1>The British broadcaster further emphasized that members of their team “always” give “careful consideration to [their] editorial decisions,” stressing that all of the network’s coverage made it evident that Kate and her family are undergoing a “difficult time.”</p><p class=p1>“We have been mindful at all times to approach our coverage with sensitivity,” the BBC concluded.</p><p class=p1>Kensington Palace announced in January that Kate had undergone a “planned” abdominal procedure and would <a href=#>cancel all her engagements</a> until after Easter. Kate’s public hiatus led to rampant speculation about her well-being before she and the royals ultimately addressed the concern.</p><p class=p1>“In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous,” Kate said in a video <a href=#>released by the palace</a> last month. “The surgery was successful, however, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy, and I’m now in the early stages of that treatment.”</p><p class=p1>She continued, “<strong>[Prince] William</strong> and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family. As you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Kate and William, 41, share three children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5, and waited to publicly share her diagnosis until they had a chance to tell their kids first.</p><p class=p1>A source later told <i>Us Weekly </i>that Kate has been leaning on her family throughout her treatment.</p><p class=p3><span class=s1>“She tires easily, but she’s been trying to spend as much time with her kids as she can,” the insider <a href=#>exclusively told <i>Us</i></a> last month.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmpNiv6a%2Fz6ilnatdqbxur86mp6WZmaPBtHnOr5yrZZmjwKa60qKroq6VYriiwMRmpKKclKGytbvNZpqorpWnrqixjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./al-roker-recalls-dramatic-weight-loss-20-years-after-gastric-bypass.html><span>←</span><span>Al Roker Recalls Dramatic Weight Loss 20 Years After Gastric Bypass</span></a>
