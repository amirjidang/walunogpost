The outlet notes that Ariana will still likely have to pay some sort of settlement, though it likely won’t be ridiculous. “As we first told you, even though there's a prenup in place, Ariana will still cut Dalton some sort of cash check ... but it won't be a crazy amount,” TMZ noted without providing a dollar figure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande’s net worth</a> is $240 million, while Dalton Gomez’s net worth is $12 million, a fortune he amassed largely from his work as a celebrity real estate agent.</p><p>Ariana and Dalton may still be legally married, but that hasn’t stopped the Victorious alum from moving in with her new partner, Ethan Slater, who’s also in the process of divorcing his wife, Lilly Jay.
