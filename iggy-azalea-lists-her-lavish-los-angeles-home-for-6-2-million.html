The home, which was listed by Shari Huntington and Tyler Van Patten of Coldwell Banker Realty, has a large kitchen, a double-height living area, and a big loft. <a href=#>The Australian rapper's mansion is 5,228 sq ft, with four bedrooms</a>, three and a half baths, and a large lagoon area. The home's entryway has wooden doors and a marble patio. The residence's interiors have a rustic vibe to them, with arched and soaring ceilings, hardwood floors, and white striped walls. The home's enormous living room features a bent couch and a newly refurbished fireplace, most likely the product of Iggy's recent construction work. The upper portion of the house has an exercise machine and a hardwood slatted floor for comfort. A two-story guesthouse with a bedroom and bathroom is included with the estate. The kitchen has an island, a hardwood ceiling with beams, and a white tiled floor. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Opera News</a>, the rapper's house is furnished with vibrant paintings on the walls and plants.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As per the ad, the baths and wardrobes have been rebuilt, and the fireplace has indeed been rebuilt. The property's rear is surrounded by a marble patio and lawn and a lagoon-style pool house and spa area. The residence has a driveway that can accommodate up to four automobiles. A kitchen on the home includes a marble washstand, a hardwood base, and wooden floors. With white curtains, a room in the house allows for lots of natural light. A workout bike and a hardwood paneled floor can be found in the home's upper section. The musician's home is outfitted with a Sonos sound system in both the interior and outdoors. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, Azalea has also obtained permission for prospective purchasers to 'expand and rebuild its front exterior of the home and internal entry, including the building of the front veranda, complete hardscape redesign of entrance and motor court.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several celebrities live in Hidden Hills, including Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Drake, and Madonna, among many others.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;NY Times Seals The Deal To Buy 'The Athletic' For $550 Million</span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Opera News</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS2qLPYZpizmZyarm64yKyrrGWYmr9uuMCvoKygXaG8tHnAp56epJWoeqm7zJ5kn6eiYoNufoymoKWkmaS7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-kevin-sussmans-net-worth-has-grown-since-the-big-bang-theory.html><span>←</span><span>Here's How Much Kevin Sussman's Net Worth Has Grown Since Playing Stuart In Big Bang Theory</span></a>
