He is the current manager of West Bromwich Albion and the England national football team. Roy Hodgson has finally landed the role as England manager which he was shortlisted for the same job in 2000. His first task will be leading England at Euro 2012. As a player, he did not quite make it into the first team at Crystal Palace in the mid-1960s, moving on to a career in non-league football that ended with Carshalton Athletic in 1976, the same year he took over as manager of Swedish side Halmstad. They were the first of three Swedish sides manager by Hodgson, who enjoyed most success with Malmo, leading them to five successive domestic championships between 1985 and 1989. With its punitive tax regime, nobody gets rich in Sweden, but during a five-year spell in Switzerland, first as coach of Neuchatel and then with the national side, Hodgson will have fared much better financially. Via Inter Milan, Blackburn Rovers, Grasshoppers Zurich, FC Copenhagen and Udinese, Hodgson went on to manage the United Arab Emirates from 2002-2004. His earnings there will have been substantial and tax-free. Before returning to manage in England, Hodgson also led Finland to the brink of qualification for Euro 2008. His most recent years as a manager in England have been his most lucrative. He earned a £1m bonus for keeping Fulham in the Premier League in 2008 (on top of his £1m a year contract). In July 2010, he moved to Liverpool on three times the money, but lasted just six months as he carried the can for poor performances. He left in January 2011 with a payoff of at least £3m, linking up with West Bromwich Albion just weeks later on reduced wages of about £1m plus bonuses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earnings-amp-financial-data>Earnings & Financial Data</h2><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Date</p></th><th scope=col><p>Category</p></th><th scope=col><p>Description</p></th><th scope=col><p>Amount</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>2013</p></td><td><p>Salary</p></td><td><p>Annual salary as manager of the England national team during the 2014 World Cup</p></td><td><p>$5,875,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BvsdOwpqusmGSutbTLnqueq1%2BYvKKvx2ipqLFdnbyls9KopWamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ricky-zieba-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Ricky Zieba Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
