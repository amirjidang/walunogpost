We receive compensation when you click on a link and make a purchase. <a href=# rel>Learn more!</a></p><p>Who else feels completely naked when they forget to wear their jewelry? It’s the tiniest part of our outfit (unless we’re into major statement necklaces) and yet it makes such a big impact. Rings, bracelets, necklaces, piercings — bring them all on and layer them up. Chains, bangles, charms and gemstones . . . we’ll take them all and wear them all at once! But right now, all of our focus is set on one ring, and honestly, it has been for a couple of years</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Duchess Ring from Jewlr</a> is a replica of <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Duchess Meghan</a></strong>’s engagement ring, which was designed by her now-husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a>, himself. Jewlr wanted to create a “stunning token of the fairy-tale romance” that anyone could wear and customize to suit their own personal style.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Meghan-Markle-Ring-Closeup.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Duchess Ring</a> (originally ranging from $184 to $1,840) starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$129</a> at Jewlr with the code WINTERSALE2019! Sale ends March 11, 2019!</strong></p><p>The ring features a cushion-cut center gemstone with two smaller, round-cut accent stones at its sides, just like the Duchess’. However, unlike her royal ring, ours doesn’t have to be an engagement ring. It certainly can be, but we can easily just wear it as a fashion statement. That’s why it’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">entirely customizable</a>!</p><p>The customization process is very straightforward and honestly, fun and exciting! We start off with the anything-but-basic metal choices. We can choose among sterling silver, as well as 10-karat and 14-karat versions of white, yellow and rose gold. Then, it’s time to move on to stones.</p><p>For the center stone, we can choose from 12 genuine stones and eight Swarovski zirconia stones, the latter of which come at no extra cost. We can keep the stone white or play with color! Included in the genuine stones are amethyst, sapphire, topaz, tourmaline and more.</p><p>We love that when we hover over each stone, Jewlr tells us which birth month it’s associated with as well as the stone’s attributes, if applicable. For example, the attributes of blue topaz are that it’s “soft, quiet and pure.” On the other end of the spectrum, the attributes of the pink tourmaline are “excitement, ambition and creativity.” We can choose our center stone based off any of these attributes, but just thinking it’s pretty is an extremely valid reason as well.</p><p>For the smaller side stones, we can either have them match or get two different colors. There are 20 genuine stone options, 14 simulated stone options and 12 Swarovski zirconia stone options. So many choices! Apart from the alexandrite, all of the simulated and zirconia stones can be added at no additional cost!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Customized-Ring.jpg><p>Next is a customization element that can make this ring even more special. Engraving! With four font choices and 16 characters worth of space, we can add a name or message to the inside of the band to keep close to us at all times. There’s also a little button we can press to insert the outline of a heart! We can put the names of ourselves and our partner, a friend’s, pet’s or family member’s name, or maybe even a celebrity crush’s name. Just saying! We could also engrave a word or short phrase with special meaning to us, like “Love always” or “Time to shop.” Make sure to use the 3D, 360-degree view to check out the customized ring from every angle!</p><p>Once we’re satisfied (a.k.a. squealing) with the look of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">our ring</a>, we can choose our ring size. There’s a handy size guide we can use if we’re unsure of what to get. We can also have our ring resized up or down two sizes within 30 days of purchase if the fit isn’t quite what we expected. Jewlr provides this service at no cost!</p><p>The last step is choosing our ring box. We can stick with the elegant, matte-black classic option, or we can continue the customization process. With the Photo Ring Box, which is currently on sale, we can upload a photo right from our device to be displayed on the box. There’s also the on-sale Customized Ring Box, on which we can put one of Jewlr’s messages or illustration templates. Examples include messages that say “Will you marry me?” and “Happy Anniversary.” There are also ones specifically for friends!</p><p>So, we lied. There’s one more step, but we’re happy it’s there. It’s choosing which free <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> we want at checkout! We can choose between either the sparkling Circle of Light Halo Necklace or the Jewlr Gem Necklace, which has silver studs forming a diamond shape. Can we have both? Please?</p><p>This sale only goes until March 11, so we can’t miss out on this chance to give ourselves <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the royal treatment</a>! If Harry’s not going to do it, someone has to.</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Duchess Ring</a> (originally ranging from $184 to $1,840) starting at just<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $129</a> at Jewlr with the code WINTERSALE2019!
