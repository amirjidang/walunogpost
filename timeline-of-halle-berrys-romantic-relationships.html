Halle Berry is arguably one of the best actresses in the entire world and Hollywood finally recognized it when they awarded her with an Oscar for her performance in the film,&nbsp;Monster’s Ball. She was the first African-American woman to be bestowed with a 'Best Actress' honor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has a track record for being a leading lady in the movie industry (especially in the James Bond franchise, where&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she formed a special 'bond' with Pierce Brosnan</a>), but she also has a track record due to her famous romances. While she’s taking a break from her dating life to focus on her children (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she is trying to home school them right now</a>), let's look back at the famous guys that have come in and out of her life over the years.</p><h2 id=the-new-kid-on-the-block-danny-wood><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>The New Kid On The Block: Danny Wood</span></h2><p>Bet you didn’t know that Halle Berry once dated a member of New Kids on The Block, the popular boy band, during the late 80s and early 90s! She and Danny Wood dated for only a short time. This was before she was a relatively famous face in Hollywood. Danny was already popular in the music world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-fling-with-the-bodyguard-himself-kevin-costner><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>A Fling With The Bodyguard Himself: Kevin Costner</span></h2><p>While he was still married to Cindy Silva, it was rumored that Kevin Costner, who was one of the more popular Hollywood actors at the time, had an affair with Halle Berry. Berry was an up-and-coming actress at the time, and rumors started flying about the fling, which was said to have happened around the time Berry was appearing in Living Dolls. She and Kevin are still friends.</p><h2 id=the-rumor-mill-wesley-snipes><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>The Rumor Mill: Wesley Snipes</span></h2><p>There were a lot of rumors flying around about what might have occurred between Halle Berry and Wesley Snipes in the early 90s. Berry said that she was in a relationship with someone who hit her. He hurt her to the point where she lost most of her hearing. People suspected it was Snipes, but this has never been definitively proved.</p><h2 id=just-gossip-or-the-real-thing-eddie-murphy><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Just Gossip Or The Real Thing: Eddie Murphy</span></h2><p>Boomerang was said to be one of Eddie Murphy’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most underrated romantic comedies</a>, and it also starred Halle Berry as his love interest. The film was released back in 1992. Rumors sparked that the two had a brief affair because they were so close on the set. He was constantly cracking her up. She was in fits of laughter during takes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Halle Berry Shows Off Her Toned Body... Thanks To Her New Home Workout Routine!</a></span></p><h2 id=a-handsome-pair-christopher-williams><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>A Handsome Pair: Christopher Williams</span></h2><p>Halle (who says she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">loves being single</a>) was in a serious relationship with R&B singer, Christopher Williams, who earned fame in the late 80s with his hit, “I’m Dreamin”. That song was on the New Jack City soundtrack. Their relationship didn’t work out, but he’s a happy father today.</p><h2 id=what-could-have-been-david-justice><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>What Could Have Been: David Justice</span></h2><p>David Justice was Halle’s first (out of three) husband; when Halle opened up about domestic abuse in her past, people suspected David. “Over the past 20 years, I’ve heard people saying, ‘Isn’t that the dude who hit Halle Berry in the head?’” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told People</a>. He has denied the rumors and is happily married now.</p><h2 id=she-was-the-love-of-his-life-shemar-moore><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Was The Love Of His Life: Shemar Moore</span></h2><p>Halle dated the Criminal Minds star for a bit, and the actor said he really fell hard for her. “I’m still grateful for that relationship,” he said, according to BET. “I was smitten not just because of who she was, but because we were so similar in so many ways. She was biracial, so she was kind of going through the same things I was in Hollywood.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Babyface Claims The Late Michael Jackson Wanted To Date Halle Berry</a></span></p><h2 id=a-monster-s-ball-rumor-billy-bob-thornton><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>A Monster's Ball Rumor: Billy Bob Thornton</span></h2><p>Yes, this is a rumor that may hold some water. When Halle and Billy Bob Thornton both starred in the award-winning Monster’s Ball, they were thrown together throughout the romantic drama, so some of that may have spilled over into their real lives. Thornton was married to Angelina Jolie at the time, and said that doing the movie with Halle made his marriage “difficult.”</p><h2 id=the-marriage-wouldn-t-last-eric-benet><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Marriage Wouldn't Last: Eric Benet</span></h2><p>Eric Benet was Halle’s second husband and the two ended up divorcing because Benet had admitted to cheating on Halle during their marriage. Halle opened up to Oprah Winfrey about their marriage. She said that she had an emotional breakdown when he told her about his affairs, but that she became stronger after the marriage failed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-starred-in-one-of-his-music-videos-and-maybe-more-fred-durst><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Starred In One Of His Music Videos And Maybe More: Fred Durst</span></h2><p>Yes, this might have happened. Back in 2003, Halle starred in Limp Bizkit’s music video for “Behind Blue Eyes”. In this video, lead singer, Fred Durst, makes out with Halle. Durst directed the music video and they actually had chemistry which translated well. That chemistry sparked rumors of an off-camera relationship. Neither has talked about whether anything IRL really happened.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Eminem Beefs That Went Way Too Far</a></span></p><h2 id=good-looking-pair-michael-ealy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Good Looking Pair: Michael Ealy</span></h2><p>Here is another example of Halle forming deep, emotional bonds with her co-stars...she and Their Eyes Were Watching God co-star, Michael Ealy, had a relationship back in 2004. After they parted ways, Halle said she was feeling like she just wanted to be out on her own...and out of a relationship for a while.</p><h2 id=chilly-breakup-gabriel-aubry><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Chilly Breakup: Gabriel Aubry</span></h2><p>While most of Halle’s relationships ended well, one relationship that did not was her pairing with the successful male model, Gabriel Aubry. Halle claims that he emotionally abused her during their relationship. Apparently, they both had to go see a therapist. These two have a child together, whom they’ve famously battled over in court.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=thought-he-was-the-one-olivier-martinez><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Thought He Was The One: Olivier Martinez</span></h2><p>Halle married Olivier Martinez shortly after her split from Aubry, whom Olivier famously got into a fistfight with. Each man blamed the other for starting the fight and no charges were filed. Martinez and Halle married in 2013, the year their son, Marco, was born. That marriage didn’t last either, and Halle was soon back on the market.</p><h2 id=the-other-kid-alex-da-kid><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Other Kid: Alex da Kid</span></h2><p>Shortly after her divorce from Martinez, Halle started dating British music producer, Alex da Kid, for around five months. The two didn’t last very long. According to sources close to Halle, she really didn’t like bringing him around her kids, so she broke up with him. Now, she’s been spending all her time with her kiddos and is just happy being single.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A List Of All The Men Jennifer Lopez Has Been Romantically Linked To</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroqWVobavsYyonWagkaG5pnnBnqmrsaNiv7C5wKeroptdp7KtrdOipqermJ69tHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-things-that-dont-make-sense-about-ross-and-rachels-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>15 Things That Don't Make Sense About Ross And Rachel's Relationship</span></a>
