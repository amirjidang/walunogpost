A Jenner source spoke to <a href=#><i>E! News</i></a> that week saying they “are fully back together.”</p><p>“They worked out their issues and decided they want to move forward and be together,” the source said, adding, “they moved on and it’s going really well. They have been spending a lot of time together recently and Devin was her date to her friend Lauren’s wedding over the weekend in Napa.”</p><p>Now, it appears Jenner is ready to be back to full-blown PDA mode, posting a photo of herself sitting on Booker’s lap on vacation to her Instagram story last night. But despite the very public display of ‘yes, we’re still dating!, apparently, the pair are actually still working on things behind-the-scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> reports that Kendall and Devin are still figuring out if a romantic relationship is the best thing for them, with a source telling the outlet that “Kendall and Devin are doing great. They know that timing is everything, and what is meant to be, will be.”</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: <a href=#>Kendall Jenner & Kim Kardashian Named In Lawsuit Against 818 Tequila</a></b></span></p><p>Their busy careers in modeling and basketball have kept them from being together as much as they would like to be, according to a source close to the couple. “Their work, travel schedules and balancing their professional lives with their personal lives can get overwhelming at times, but their love for one another draws them back to each other.”</p><p>Part of the reason they’re still trying to work things out is that they truly love each other and “can be real and raw and completely and authentically themselves,” the source said. “There’s no filter, and they love that about their relationship.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kendall Jenner and her on-again NBA star boyfriend Devin Booker have been spotted front row at Marni’s New York Fashion Week one-off show, venturing across the river to Brooklyn to see the action.
