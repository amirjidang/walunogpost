<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>Super Affiliate Blog Birthday, 1 Year Later</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>One year ago today, I wrote my <a href=#>first post</a> and the blog going live. Awesomely enough the blog went live on St.Patrick’s day… so it would seem I’ve had the luck of the Irish on my side. Thousands of comments, <strong>2,100+</strong> subscribers and <strong>300+</strong> posts later, the blog has become everything I had hoped for. Not only have I been able to help spread my wealth of information, but I have also met so many readers and other influential bloggers along the way. After attending BlogWorld back in November and Affiliate Summit just last month, it only impressed upon me that much more how important the blog is, and how many people actually read the blog that I didn’t even know about.</p><p>So what’s to come? The first nine months of running the blog were on a custom designed layout with no advertisements or revenue monetization in place. Once I met up with <a href=# rel=noopener>UniqueBlogDesigns</a> at BlogWorld, ZacJohnson.com quickly went live with it’s new design, which allowed for monthly case study reports on how blogs can be monetized to turn a profit. Since then the blog has successfully be earning a few thousands dollars a month, while giving better exposure to top article posts, comments, picture galleries and top advertisers/affiliate networks in the industry. Through the life of this blog I will continue to post on industry news, new affiliate programs, marketing methods, conference coverage and my experiences over the years… things will only continue to get better!</p><p align=center><strong>Comparison Between Original Design & New Monetized Blog Design</strong></p><p>When I first started ZacJohnson.com back in <u>March 2007</u>, it was my first attempt at running a blog, and I wanted to make sure it was done right. There is so much anticipation when you are starting a new blog. You want to provide the best content you can, but in the beginning you have no readers. However, as the saying goes, “build it and they will come“. I did my best to focus on providing quality content and tried to write a new post at least 3-5 times a week, now I try and get a least one post in daily. In the beginning it’s tough and we all hit “writer’s block” sometimes, but as you get more familiar with your readers and writing it gets easier. After working on the blog and writing for a few weeks, I went ahead with my first review, which was featured on <a href=# rel=noopener>John Chow’s blog</a>. Now it’s becoming a passion… and something I look forward to everyday!</p><p><strong>Happy St. Patrick’s Day!</strong></p><p>Here we are, one year later and I am so excited for the future. With the recent explosion of “Make Money” blogs, they seem to be everywhere. Some people are complaining, but I think it’s a good thing… even if some of these bloggers are new to the industry, I’m sure they still have something we can learn from. Happy St. Patrick’s Day and I wish you, your families and your blog/business or money making efforts all the <strong><span>luck</span></strong> and success of the Irish! (and a little luck from <a href=#>Rocky</a> too)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiykZi3sLTNrKanZpOkunC%2F1Kmcq2WRm7OquMiaq55lkqG8qHnBoqmtoJSWxm59jLKcmqpdoa61sdFo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scotch-storch-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Scott Storch Net Worth How Much is Storch Worth?</span></a>
