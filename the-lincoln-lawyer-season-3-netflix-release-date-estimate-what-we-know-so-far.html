A lot is already known about the show’s upcoming season, which has begun production and cast many new faces for the upcoming ten episodes. Here’s everything we know so far about The Lincoln Lawyer season 3.</strong></p><p>Released in July and August 2023 across two volumes, season 2 of The Lincoln Lawyer adapted The Fifth Witness (with some key differences), seeing the return of Manuel Garcia-Rulfo plus the addition of some new faces such as Lana Parrilla playing the role of Lisa Trammell.</p><h2 class=toc-title>Table of Contents</h2><h3 id=has-the-lincoln-lawyer-been-renewed-for-season-3-1>Has The Lincoln Lawyer been Renewed for Season 3?</h3><p><strong>Official Renewal Status:</strong> Renewed on August 30th</p><p>On August 30th, Netflix confirmed that the show had been given a third-season renewal.</p><p>Ahead of its official renewal, we heard rumblings of a third season for The Lincoln Lawyer season 3 ahead of volume 2 released, with early plans drawn up for an additional season ahead of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes from May through November 2023.</p><p>Season 3 will again consist of 10 episodes and will be based on the fifth book in The Lincoln Lawyer series by Michael Connelly, The Gods of Guilt.</p><p>Neve Campbell, who plays Maggie McPherson on the show, reportedly originally wasn’t expected to return in any capacity for the new season. However, that doesn’t seem to be the case, as we’ll cover in the production news section below. Her character (spoiler alert) has moved to San Diego in the show, so she may only feature henceforth with text messages or mentions by Mickey’s daughter.</p><p>Ted Humphrey and Dailyn Rodriguez (showrunners on the series) said on the renewal:</p><p>“The audience response to the show has been so gratifying and wonderful, and we are thrilled to have the opportunity to dive back into Michael Connelly’s universe and bring Mickey Haller and his world to the screen again.”</p><p>Peter Friedlander, Vice President of Scripted Series, Netflix, US and Canada said:</p><p>“We’re thrilled to bring back The Lincoln Lawyer for a third season. Ted Humphrey and Dailyn Rodriguez have taken us deeper into Mickey Haller’s world, building out characters and stories that have connected with our global audience, and we look forward to seeing what they have in store for everyone’s favorite lawyer. The show continues to top our global lists and it’s a testament to the work from a creative powerhouse team including Michael Connelly, David E. Kelley, Ross Fineman and our partners at A+E Studios.”</p><p>What did various team members behind the show say ahead of renewal?</p><p>The <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="noopener noreferrer">NYTimes spoke</a> to the showrunner Ted Humphrey, who confirmed that a writer’s room for the third season had been established before the WGA strike beginning on May 1st, 2023.</p><p>Humphrey, when asked what’s next for the show, told them:</p><p>“Right now it depends not only on how Season 2 does, but also on the resolution of the strikes. We had to shut down our writers’ room for Season 3 when the Writers Guild contract expired. We’ve done Michael Connelly picket events where Michael and the staff from “The Lincoln Lawyer” and “Bosch” have picketed together. We’re out there because the issues are real and have to be resolved, and the only way that’s going to happen is by the companies sitting back down with us to make a fair deal. Hopefully that happens soon, and once it does, we will be back to work on a third season.”</p><p>Indeed, a WGA listing currently appears for The Lincoln Lawyer season 3, once again suggesting that the show was headed for renewal ahead of the strike.</p><p>Had the show been released a little earlier in the year, we’d have likely seen it given an early <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>renewal order</a> afforded to The Diplomat, FUBAR, and others.</p><p>In conclusion, it looks like The Lincoln Lawyer is eying up a renewal, assuming it can hit internal Netflix targets (not available to Joe public) and the strikes come to a resolution soon.</p><img data-dominant-color=6e6c64 data-has-transparency=false decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-499721 title="the lincoln lawyer season 3 sets renewal netflix" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.whats-on-netflix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-lincoln-lawyer-season-3-sets-renewal-netflix-jpg.webp alt="the lincoln lawyer season 3 sets renewal netflix" width=1200 height=675 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-499721 class=wp-caption-text>Picture: Netflix</p><h3 id=how-well-did-the-lincoln-lawyer-season-2-perform-on-netflix-2>How well did The Lincoln Lawyer Season 2 perform on Netflix?</h3><p>Every Tuesday, Netflix updates its top 10 website to get a weekly snapshot of how many hours were watched globally and how many completed viewing equivalents (CVE for short) were done.</p><p>Unlike most shows where we can tell pretty quickly how well they’re doing, sadly, season 2 of The Lincoln Lawyer isn’t quite like that. That’s because the season was split, and when volume 2 comes out, all viewing stats that Netflix releases are muddied together within season 2 (Netflix does not split volumes 1 and 2 seperately.</p><p>With that said, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>season 2 featured in the Netflix top 10s for eight weeks</a>, picking up 235.10 million hours watched, which equates to 40 million completed viewing equivalents.</p><h3 id=where-is-the-lincoln-lawyer-season-3-in-production-3>Where is The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3 in Production?</h3><p>When the series was first renewed, it was unclear where production was. Given the renewal, we suspect scripts were in development ahead of the May 2023 WGA stoppage.</p><p>In mid-November 2023, following the end of the SAG-AFTRA strike, we learned that The Lincoln Lawyer would be <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>one of the first returning Netflix Originals</a> to get back into <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>production in January 2024</a>.</p><p>On January 18th, Netflix confirmed that filming was underway for the new season and provided a first-look production picture and first-look picture of Neve Campbell as Maggie Mcpherson and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as Mickey Halle in the new season.</p><img data-dominant-color=694733 data-has-transparency=false decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-518999 title="First Look At The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.whats-on-netflix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/first-look-at-the-lincoln-lawyer-season-3-jpeg.webp alt="First Look At The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3" width=1013 height=675 sizes="(max-width: 1013px) 100vw, 1013px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-518999 class=wp-caption-text>First look at The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3</p><img data-dominant-color=636e7c data-has-transparency=false decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-519000 title="Filming On The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3 Begins" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.whats-on-netflix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/filming-on-the-lincoln-lawyer-season-3-begins-jpeg.webp alt="Filming On The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3 Begins" width=1013 height=675 sizes="(max-width: 1013px) 100vw, 1013px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-519000 class=wp-caption-text>First day of production on The Lincoln Lawyer season 3</p><p>The budget for the series is reportedly somewhere between $3 and $5 million an episode, and it will continue to be filmed in the Los Angeles area.</p><p>Filming is expected to wrap on the new season on May 31st, 2024.</p><h3 id=when-will-the-lincoln-lawyer-season-3-be-released-on-netflix-4>When will The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3 be released on Netflix?</h3><p>The title was notably missing from Netflix’s slate reveal for 2024, so at the moment, <strong>The Lincoln Lawyer season 3 will be coming to Netflix sometime in 2025</strong>. Given the production schedule, we’d expect that to be pretty early in the year (Q1-Q2 2025). There’s no word on whether they’ll split up season 3 like <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>they did with season 2.</a></p><h3 id=what-to-expect-from-the-lincoln-lawyer-season-3-5>What to expect from The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3</h3><p>Warning: Spoilers ahead.</p><p>Season 2, Episode 10 results in Mickey Haller winning one of his most challenging cases to date, with Lisa’s case finally ending. Although Lisa got a Not Guilty verdict, we’re presuming that she did get arrested for the murder of her ex-husband. Mickey now meets with a new client, which seems to set up the plot for season 3 with the lawyer identifying Gloria Dayton (aka Glory Days), who has been murdered.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a> confirmed the book that will be covered in the third season of The Lincoln Lawyer. Should the show get renewed, the showrunner unveiled to them that Michael Connelly’s The Gods of Guilt would be the basis of the third season.</p><p>To recap how the book series has been adapted in order thus far:</p><ul><li>The Lincoln Lawyer (2005)</li><li>The Brass Verdict (2008) – adapted in season 1</li><li>The Reversal (2010)</li><li>The Fifth Witness (2011) – adapted in season 2</li><li><strong>The Gods of Guilt (2013) – to be adapted in season 3</strong></li><li>The Law of Innocence (2020)</li><li>Resurrection Walk (2023)</li></ul><p>Per <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="noopener noreferrer">GoodReads</a>, here’s a rundown of the fifth The Lincoln Lawyer book entry:</p><p>“Mickey Haller gets the text, “Call me ASAP – 187,” and the California penal code for murder immediately gets his attention. Murder cases have the highest stakes and the biggest paydays, and they always mean Haller has to be at the top of his game.</p><p>When Mickey learns that the victim was his own former client, a prostitute he thought he had rescued and put on the straight and narrow path, he knows he is on the hook for this one. He soon finds out that she was back in LA and back in the life. Far from saving her, Mickey may have been the one who put her in danger.</p><p>Haunted by the ghosts of his past, Mickey must work tirelessly and bring all his skill to bear on a case that could mean his ultimate redemption or proof of his ultimate guilt.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-502210 title="the gods of guilt book cover the lincoln lawyer" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.whats-on-netflix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-gods-of-guilt-book-cover-the-lincoln-lawyer.jpg alt="the gods of guilt book cover the lincoln lawyer" width=768 height=1170 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-502210 class=wp-caption-text>Book cover for The Gods of Guilt with Netflix sticker.</p><h3 id=new-cast-for-the-lincoln-lawyer-season-3-6>New Cast For The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3</h3><p><img data-dominant-color=9e6d5b data-has-transparency=false decoding=async title="The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3 New Cast Member Grid" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.whats-on-netflix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/the-lincoln-lawyer-season-3-new-cast-member-grid-jpg.webp alt="The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3 New Cast Member Grid" width=1480 height=1289 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>We’ve had three waves of casting announcements, and they call via Deadline.
