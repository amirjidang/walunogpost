They got so bad they had to go to the hospital. My Dad took her to the hospital and we found out sure enough it was a brain tumor.</p><p>It was pretty short. I think it was about two years until she passed. I mean it was pretty quick and it just got worse and worse. I’ll never forget when she started chemo and she was losing her hair and these visions that are kinda still blurry and we would go in and see her in that shape. She was so tough man. She was still just an incredible woman and mom, even in that state. I still every now and then stop by her grave and talk to her. I pray to her every night – along with God – to protect me every night in this craziness that I do. She’s been with me all the way.</p><p>I think I was too young. After she passed we were in the room and we went down to the cafeteria – first time I’ve ever seen my dad cry because he’s not the type of guy. He still, to this day, never says, ‘I love you.’ He is hardcore. Tears were running down his face and he said, ‘Boys, we’ve got to move on.’ God, I’ll never forget that….Motherless, he raised us right.</p><p>Later on Matt played the father role for awhile. He had just started college at UNC Charlotte for like engineering, you know that’s a real smart dude. He had to stop that because my&nbsp;Dad had this close call with an aneurysm….Matt was driving me around and he would take my to high school. He played the father role there for awhile.</p><p>I’m more sociable when I’m high, I guess. I’m a very quiet person. I always have been. I think that’s probably the main reason. Just around crowds and stuff it made me more open and want to talk more. I think it must be from my Mom. I never got to know her that well, so I think I might have got it from her. I think Matt, as far as being sociable, is more like my Dad when it comes to communication….I think I’m more like her in that aspect of life with just being shy.</p><p>I haven’t stopped drinking. I stopped drinking and driving. I haven’t stopped drinking completely, so I do still drink. You can drink. Just don’t do it again and that’s one thing, I’m never doing any kind of driving, if it’s one drink or whatever. Naturally, I don’t drink as much. I mainly like to drink before I sing now. It’s one of those things I need to go over because I know I don’t need it; but, still in my mind I’m going, ‘I just need it. I’m so nervous.’ I’ve done a few without it and they’ve been fine; but, I always feel like it’s a little better [drinking]&nbsp;and I know that’s shallow or whatever. As far as that, it is in total control and sadly the DUI helped me with that. You don’t have to stop completely. You’re not that&nbsp;kind of person. You can control this and I will. Eventually I’m gonna stop all together because as we get older…you’re heart is one muscle that can’t rebuild itself and if you do too much damage to it, you’re in for it.</p><p>Readers interested in&nbsp;listening to&nbsp;Lilian Garcia’s interview with Jeff Hardy in its entirety may do so below:</p><p></p><h2 class=xe-gallery__title>The Hardy Boys Wizard World</h2><ul class=xe-gallery__items><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>The Hardy Boys Wizard World</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/the-hardy-boys-wizard-world/gettyimages-691412864.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>The Hardy Boys Wizard World</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/the-hardy-boys-wizard-world/gettyimages-691412894.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>The Hardy Boys Wizard World</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/the-hardy-boys-wizard-world/gettyimages-691412916.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--ad"></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>The Hardy Boys Wizard World</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/the-hardy-boys-wizard-world/gettyimages-691412920.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>The Hardy Boys Wizard World</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/the-hardy-boys-wizard-world/gettyimages-691412926.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>The Hardy Boys Wizard World</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/the-hardy-boys-wizard-world/gettyimages-691412948.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--ad"></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>The Hardy Boys Wizard World</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/the-hardy-boys-wizard-world/gettyimages-691412984.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>The Hardy Boys Wizard World</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/the-hardy-boys-wizard-world/gettyimages-691413016.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>The Hardy Boys Wizard World</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/the-hardy-boys-wizard-world/gettyimages-691413030.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--ad"></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>The Hardy Boys Wizard World</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/the-hardy-boys-wizard-world/gettyimages-691413084.jpg></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfY9pZ29vZWKubr7En6Oem6Sew6Z5yZ6dn2WYlr%2BlxYyop56mo2LCsXnOp2SwoKlitaZ5yKylrWWimq6lxYytpmappZ7BbrDRoqWkoZ6ceq670Z4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-traumatic-events-and-the-celebs-who-survived-them.html><span>←</span><span>15 Traumatic Events And The Celebs Who Survived Them</span></a>
