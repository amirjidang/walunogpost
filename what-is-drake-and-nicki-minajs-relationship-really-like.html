As they both started their careers under the same label and would be featured in a handful of songs together, the two have an undeniably sweet chemistry that can really fool people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Nicki has other famous friends,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">such as Ariana Grande</a>, and Drake recently revealed a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> previous relationship with Sophie Brussaux</a>, the relationship between Nicki and Drake is not without hot moments or tea-spilling drama! Drake and Nicki have thrown shade at each other, made up, and repeated the entire cycle. Right now, things seem to be chill between the two.</p><p>So, what is their relationship really like? Here are some moments between the two throughout the years, which will help you to understand their dynamic a little better.</p><h2 id=working-together-at-the-turn-of-the-decade><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Working Together At The Turn Of The Decade</span></h2><p>There is one rapper you can expect to be associated with Nicki and Drake. That is&nbsp;New Orleans rapper, Lil Wayne, as he, Drake, and Nicki worked under the label Cash Money/Young Money. That was where they would first interact.</p><p>In some of their earlier songs (especially Nicki's), you can hear tributes to "Young Money".&nbsp; because the label gave these rappers strong starts in their music careers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wanting-to-get-hitched-to-her><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Wanting To Get Hitched To Her</span></h2><p>Drake released his debut album,&nbsp;Thank Me Later, in 2010, and in the single, "Miss Me," he was pretty straightforward, thanks to a surprising set of lyrics. In the song, he references Queens-born rapper, Minaj: "I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it/I hope one day we get married just to say we f---in' did it."</p><p>This wasn't the only time the thought of marrying Nicki came into play, as he would reference it in Nicki's single, "Moment&nbsp;4 Life."</p><h2 id=dating-rumors-escalated><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Dating Rumors Escalated</span></h2><p>Even before the famous dance Nicki did for Drake in 2014, rumors about the two dating each other were on the rise. Their performance at the&nbsp;Hot 97 Thanksgiving Thank You Concert brought a lot of speculation - Nicki and Drake shared a kiss at the end.</p><p>Before the situation could get heated up, because fans saw them lock lips, Nicki told the audience, "I still got my lipstick on! I know you New York - don't be starting something."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What We Know About Nicki Minaj’s Life After Meeting Her Husband, Kenneth Petty</a></span></p><h2 id=confessing-a-crush><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Confessing A Crush</span></h2><p>It would take no time for the two to address the romantic rumors that were circulating. There was one specific instance that got fans swooning. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake admitted on MTV</a> that the first time he saw Nicki, he immediately fell in love.</p><p>Drake&nbsp;would continue on about how he had a super-huge crush on Nicki but ended his sentence by saying she considered him a little brother. It sounds sad at first, but that's another type of closeness that still matters, right?</p><h2 id=getting-married-on-twitter><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Getting Married... On Twitter</span></h2><p>It may not have been official, but the Twitter world was shocked when Drake tweeted out that Nicki should be referred to as Mrs. Aubrey Drake Graham. He ended the tweet with, "She's all mine :)," and Nicki backed up their Twitter marriage, tweeting out, "Yes, its true. Drake and I tied the knot."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This would not be the first time they teased fans about tying the knot, as the two would appear in the music video for "Moment&nbsp;4 Life," which features the two getting married.</p><h2 id=their-moment-4-life><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Their Moment&nbsp;4 Life</span></h2><p>2010 was definitely the 'moment for life' for both Drake and Nicki. Not only were they starting out their careers, but they were getting really close. They had their fair share of moments and Drake has commented on how he loves Nicki's look. Of course, he's also been open in previous tweets about wanted to marry Nicki.</p><p>While the two were close like family (or arguably, as close as romantic partners), things would take a sour turn in their relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A List Of The Beautiful Women Drake Has Dated In The Past</a></span></p><h2 id=suddenly-not-talking><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Suddenly Not Talking?</span></h2><p>While it is endearing to see Drake and Nicki side by side, being flirty or rapping, even they have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their ups and downs in their relationship</a>. In his song, "Tuscan Leather", he had lyrics that summed things up:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Not even talkin' to Nicki/Communication is breaking". That was enough to leave fans wondering what was going on. He explained the lyric further, stating that the two hadn't spoken for eight or nine months before the song dropped.</p><h2 id=explaining-her-side-of-the-situation><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Explaining Her Side Of The Situation</span></h2><p>So what was Nicki's stance on the sudden silence between them? She was apparently angry at Drake for not bringing her or the Young Money family onboard for his album,&nbsp;Nothing Was the Same. Nicki considers herself a team player and is very loyal to her record company.</p><p>This was a dark period for them when they didn't talk for nearly a year. It would take time to heal the wounds but, eventually, they would rekindle their friendship.</p><h2 id=back-to-being-close-friends><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Back To Being Close Friends</span></h2><p>Eventually, when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake appeared on Ellen</a>, he displayed pics of female artists he might have dated...or not. He was straightforward when Rihanna showed up, but when Nicki appeared after, he said that they are like family and that he loves her with all her heart. He also quickly mentioned that they haven't shared romantic moments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Rumors Nicki Minaj Wishes Would Quietly Disappear</a></span></p><h2 id=the-iconic-dance><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Iconic Dance</span></h2><p>Things were already getting hot and heavy when Nicki released her music video for "Anaconda," but things began to escalate when Drake appeared in a shot where he was sitting on a chair and Nicki comes towards him. She then starts dancing suggestively in front of him.</p><p>Drake's reaction was definitely natural and he was honestly honored to be picked for a cameo appearance. He tweeted,&nbsp;"Def the best invite to a video shoot EVER. #ViewsFromMyChair #MyAnacondaWasWayUp," and that was quite the response for someone who's close to Nicki.</p><h2 id=troubled-times-with-her-new-man><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Troubled Times With Her New Man</span></h2><p>Things would get intense with Drake and Nicki's friendship when the latter was dating Meek Mill. Due to her beau calling out the Canadian rapper for not writing his lyrics, it caused a rift in her relationship with Drake and Meek Mill. This caused Drake to release a diss track, "Charged Up", that hinted at a possible hook up between him and Nicki.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then, he would release a diss track about Nicki, and after a downward spiral of events, the two were no longer on speaking terms.</p><h2 id=working-things-out-again><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Working Things Out Again</span></h2><p>Once Nicki and Meek Mill called it quits, with the former confirming her status on Twitter, fans were wondering what Drake was going to do. After the beef that occurred between them, it was quite a shock when the two were seen together in an Instagram picture from Nicki.</p><p>It is rumored that Drake is going to be a part of Nicki's fifth studio album, and, as if their relationship was stronger, the two were seen getting close at a charity event. They were even playfully flirting occasionally. The end result? These two have a strong bond that we hope doesn't break.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake’s Love Life: 15 Rumors He Wishes Would Quietly Disappear</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecOrmKSdXZa7pXnNopqkoV2itq%2Btyaxkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXaeyorjLsmSloZuafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-anthony-mason-salary-is-he-leaving.html><span>←</span><span>What is Anthony Mason Salary?
