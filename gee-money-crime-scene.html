However, a new court filing reveals one of the key eyewitnesses to Gee Money’s killing is facing his homicide charges in Tigerland.&nbsp;</p><p>The development has led to questions about whether the witness’s legal troubles may compromise the prosecution’s case against Fields.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Details of Gee Money’s Death</h2><p>Gee Money or Garrett Burton was a member of the Top Boy Gorilla (TBG) rap group. In September 2017, the 22-year-old was shot down outside his music studio in Dallas Drive, Baton Rouge, allegedly by Deandre Fields, who drove from New Roads, Louisiana, to the studio.&nbsp;</p><p>Fields was associated with NBA YoungBoy, the founder of the Never Broke Again (NBA) music group, and a rival of TBG.</p><p>The feud between these two musical gangs began when Gee Money released a song containing derogatory remarks about NBA YoungBoy’s sister.&nbsp;</p><p>The situation escalated with both sides exchanging social media posts and personal insults, leading to Gee Money’s death.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Court Proceedings</h2><p>Deandre Fields had faced an arrest warrant for quite some time due to eyewitness accounts of his involvement in Gee Money’s murder.&nbsp;</p><p>Police had interrogated Fields early on, but he initially denied any involvement. However, a warrant for his phone records revealed that he was in Baton Rouge during the time of the murder. Furthermore, when asked by police if he knew anyone who would kill somebody for the NBA, Fields answered, “To be honest, me.”</p><p>Fields was indicted on second-degree murder in 2021, almost four years after Gee Money’s death.&nbsp;</p><p>He has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is expected later this year. However, a recent development in the case has brought a twist and a potential snag to the trial proceedings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Witness’s Connection to the Case</h2><p>Donavon Cortez Jefferson, a witness to Gee Money’s murder, is now facing second-degree murder charges in an unrelated homicide in Tigerland.&nbsp;</p><p>Jefferson was one of six eyewitnesses present when Gee Money was killed. In October 2021, a court filing indicated that Jefferson was facing murder charges in an unrelated case, prompting concerns about any potential conflict of interest, particularly since Jefferson was previously represented by the same public defender’s office that is currently representing Fields.&nbsp;</p><p>Assistant Public Defender Margaret Lagattuta filed a motion to relieve the office from representing Fields and have a new attorney appointed to represent him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Impact on the Case</h2><p>Judge Beau Higginbotham, who is presiding over Fields’ case, granted the motion to relieve the public defender’s office.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, Fields now has a new attorney while Jefferson’s case is being handled by a different judge. It remains unclear how Jefferson’s legal troubles could impact the Fields case’s progress, particularly given that he was present at the crime scene and was a possible key witness for the prosecution.&nbsp;</p><p>East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore III has not made any statements regarding this but said that it was still an ongoing matter.</p><p>A Baton Rouge judge has revoked Lit Yoshi’s $1.82 million bond following the discovery of five guns, ammunition, and a bulletproof vest in a Florida home where the rapper was under house arrest awaiting trial.&nbsp;</p><p>The decision made by State District Judge Tarvald Smith means that Edwards, who is facing seven counts of attempted first-degree murder, will remain in jail until his trial.&nbsp;</p><p>The charges against Edwards come as a result of two rap-rivalry shootings that occurred in Baton Rouge last year, as well as a rap-related shooting in Slidell.&nbsp;</p><p>With the discovery of these new items, the FBI agent’s testimony against Edwards was enough to convince the judge to revoke his bond and detain him until the trial.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Takeaway</h2><p>The slaying of Gee Money was a tragedy, highlighting the high stakes of the rap industry’s inter-gang feuds.&nbsp;</p><p>While Deandre Fields faces second-degree murder charges, the recent revelation of a key witness’s homicide charges has raised some questions about the case’s integrity.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, police are continuing their investigation, focusing on Deandre Field’s alleged involvement in the shooting. Gee Money’s death remains an example of the deadly impact of rap feuds, and it is essential to de-escalate such situations in the future.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCzxJ5kpqeemsZur9GipJ5lo5iyr7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./framber-valdez-wife-is-framber-valdez-married.html><span>←</span><span>Framber Valdez Wife: Is Framber Valdez Married?</span></a>
