During a 2017 appearance on The Late Late Show With Stephen Colbert, the Horrible Bosses star dished on his first interaction with Wilde.
“I actually came off looking a lot cooler than I really am because I had heard through the grapevine, through mutual friends that weren’t exactly her best girlfriends, that would report back, ‘Oh, you know, I think she’s dating someone,’ so I didn’t make any sort of moves,” he recalled at the time."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I felt I had something to prove,” she explained at the time. “If you fall off a horse, you get back up. I am not a quitter. I hung on for as long as possible, until it was more hurtful to stay.”</p><p>Wilde continued, “I’m so grateful for the pain and the heartbreak. It gave me the courage to leave and brought me to the great love of my life.”</p><p>The Tron: Legacy star also told the publication that she <a href=#>wasn’t necessarily looking for love</a> when she first met Sudeikis, adding, “I was just learning to be by myself; I’d been divorced nine months. We were both seeing people but were single. He seemed to really see me, see through the bulls–t.”</p><p>Wilde and Sudeikis announced their engagement in 2013. They are now <a href=#>parents of son Otis and daughter Daisy</a>.</p><p>Speaking to Net-a-Porter’s <a href=#>Porter Edit</a> in February 2016, Wilde explained how she believed becoming a parent alongside Sudeikis was a stronger commitment for the couple than tying the knot.</p><p>“We are seriously connected,” she said. “Before you have a child, <a href=#>marriage is the ultimate commitment and promise</a> to one another, and then once you have a child, it’s like, ‘Oh, we’re committed and promised already.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in November 2020 that the longtime couple’s romance came to an end.</p><p>Scroll down to see a complete timeline of Wilde and Sudeikis’ romance throughout the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvK211aKYZq%2BZobGmecCnm2aikai8r3nSrpueoZuewG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mq6KllaG2r7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicole-melichar-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-346145-html.html><span>←</span><span>Nicole Melichar Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
