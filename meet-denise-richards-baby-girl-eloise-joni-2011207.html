"She is a cuddle bug. She loves being hugged and held. She's such a beautiful little baby and little soul."</p><p>Though she's "been with her since the day she was born," Richards admits that the adoption process was far from easy. "Some people think if a celebrity wants a baby, they get one the next day. The adoption took two years, and there were times I felt discouraged, times when I got close to adopting a baby and it fell through. But I knew the right baby would find us."</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Friendly Hollywood exes</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Currently on good terms with her ex ("We talk every day"), Richards adds that Sheen, 45, has spent time with baby Eloise. "He knows how much I love, love kids, so he was very supportive," the actress — whose memoir, The Real Girl Next Door, is out July 26 — tells <strong>Us</strong>. "Charlie is truly very happy for me. He knows I always wanted more kids."</p><p>For more on Richards' new bundle of joy — including how she broke the adoption news to Sam and Lola, plans for a baby shower, and much more — pick up the new issue of <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, out now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamnZWpeqWxzaKqnmWinrCprdGdqmaakZfGbrPIq6NmnZyktrSxjKOmp6FdZ31yfZFpbmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matt-damon-luciana-barroso-relationship-marriage-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Matt Damon And Luciana Barroso: Everything We Know About Their Marriage</span></a>
