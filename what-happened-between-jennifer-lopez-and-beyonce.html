Although she doesn't seem to have come out and directly insulted Beyoncé, it seems Lopez has made comments about the singer in the past that could have been taken the wrong way.</p><p>According to Republic World, while promoting her film, Hustlers, Lopez took a quiz for BuzzFeed with some of her co-stars. During the quiz, J. Lo apparently "playfully threw shade" at several top female celebrities. When each person in the group was asked to "pick a fierce red carpet look that spoke to them," they were given several options. One was "Beyoncé's (look) at the Tidal Event 2015."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lopez answered, "I'm not a fan of any of these really. These are like, not their best looks." But it seems that "it was all said in a light-hearted manner and in good fun."</p><p>The Selena actor has also mentioned watching Beyoncé's Super Bowl performance, naming hers among several others Lopez has watched.</p><h2 id=has-beyonce-said-anything-about-jennifer-lopez>Has Beyoncé Said Anything About Jennifer Lopez?</h2><p>Beyoncé, who is known not to give many public interviews, hasn't spoken out much publicly against Jennifer Lopez. However, in one interview with People En Espanol, the Crazy in Love<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">singer had nothing but good things to say about the Hustlers actor</a>.</p><p>When Beyoncé was asked "What Hispanic figures have you grown up admiring?" Along with including others in her answer, the Black Parade singer replied, "Well, definitely Jennifer Lopez. I completely admire her story of growing up in the Bronx and the success that she's had and the empire that she's created."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Continuing, the If I Were a Boy singer added, "She's a very intelligent woman. I got a chance to work with her on the (2005) Pepsi commercial. She's unbelievably beautiful and talented."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Does Beyoncé Refuse To Do Reality Television</a></span></p><p>Although the two don't speak about each other much publicly, fans have noticed that Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez have copied each other's looks more than once. Could they have been trying to outdo each other, or paying a compliment to each other?</p><h2 id=the-two-have-copied-each-other-39-s-look-more-than-once>The Two Have Copied Each Other's Look More Than Once</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar51944229.jpg><p>Both Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez are top-notch entertainers who know how to give their audiences an amazing performance. The two have also worn each other's looks on more than one occasion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's pretty normal for celebrities to be noticed wearing similar outfits on different occasions. Some celebrities have even found themselves wearing nearly identical outfits in the same place.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Stars Who Wore The Same Outfit On The Red Carpet</a></span></p><p>According to The Sun, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyoncé and Lopez have been noticed wearing similar outfits</a> - on different occasions - more than once throughout the years. The outfit Lopez performed in, a "sheer black bodystocking", at the 2020 American Music Awards reminded several watching of what the singer wore in her 2014 Grammy performance.</p><p>For a 2005 concert, "Beyoncé wore a shimmering red sequin flame-effect dress". At a 2012 concert, Lopez performed in a dress that looked "nearly identical" to Queen Bey's.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2004, Beyoncé copied Lopez's look from her performance at the 1999 Billboard Music Awards. In 2008, Beyoncé wore a gown for a music video that was very similar to a dress Jennifer Lopez wore in 1998 to the Cannes Film Festival.</p><p>Many have said Lopez's performance with Maluma at the 2020 AMA's went beyond just copying Beyoncé's look. The Pa' Ti singer faced backlash for her performance, especially from fans in the Bey-Hive.</p><p>Although artists will copy or even steal certain ideas from each other, <a href=#>some say Lopez's performance was far too similar to Beyoncé's</a>.</p><h2 id=are-beyonce-and-jennifer-lopez-friends>Are Beyoncé And Jennifer Lopez Friends?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar50070731.jpg><p>Jennifer Lopez joined Beyoncé's Chime For Change: The Sound Of Change live concert in 2013. Lopez also shared a picture of herself with the Dangerously in Love singer at the Vanity Fair Oscar after party on her Instagram with the caption, "Me and B," according to Mamas Latinas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Harper's Bazaar, in 2020 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lopez also showed off a look from one of Beyoncé's fashion lines</a>. "J. Lo decided to showcase some pieces from Beyoncé's latest Ivy Park collection. Captioning the pictures, "Swaggy Saturday", Lopez said her then-fiancé Alex Rodriguez had taken the pictures.</p><p>Maybe the two have copied each other on purpose throughout the years because they were drawn to what the other was wearing and thought the outfit would work for a certain performance or event. However, the imitation outfits could be a coincidence, or because of another reason.</p><p>The two haven't said anything about sharing a friendship, so there's no way to know if they're actually friends, or ever have been. They worked together previously, filming a Pepsi commercial in 2005, so there's a chance a friendship could have formed then. But if they ever have been friends, is that friendship still intact?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmopWju6qyxKtkpaegmsdurc2dZJudqaS7pLGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./violent-minds-killers-on-tape-what-did-don-york-do-and-where-is-he-now-628182-html.html><span>←</span><span>Violent Minds: Killers on Tape What did Don York do and where is he now?</span></a>
