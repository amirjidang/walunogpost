I cannot recall one time in the over a decade of John Cena’s career where he phoned it in even once. He’s incapable, just like I’m incapable.</p><p>“He is a tremendous role model. Not just for me as a professional wrestler, but for everybody around the world, because he teaches you how important hard work is.”</p><p>The AEW World Champion also stated that he and Cena discussed transitioning from wrestling to acting.
