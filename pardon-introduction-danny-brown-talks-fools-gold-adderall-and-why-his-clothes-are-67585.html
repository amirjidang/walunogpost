There’s a lot of bugged out artists on Fool’s Gold.
I’m bugged out myself, so I fit right in.
You might be the first rapper to advocate Adderall usage."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Weed is usually the drug of choice.</strong></span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span>&nbsp;I fuck with the weed too but Adderall’s more of a working thing. You could be a lazy stoner that’s doing nothing, but you know you gotta balance it out.</span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span><strong>Who introduced you to it?</strong></span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span>Some white chick. Oh no, actually, I saw an MTV documentary, the True Life shits. I was like ‘damn, this shit ain’t even that bad’ (laughs)</span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span><strong>I think that was meant to be more of a cautionary tale…</strong></span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span>Yeah but that seemed like it would help with the music. Trying to smoke 20 blunts a day, you’ll fuck around and fall asleep at 9 o’ clock. Adderall keep you up.</span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span><strong>You said on Twitter that you knocked out 17 tracks last night, is that true?</strong></span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span>It was just, you know, one of them nights. I gotta go back and listen to them. It was a lot of shit that I was (already) working on.</span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span><strong>What’s the difference between your albums and mixtapes?</strong></span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span>Every album, I’ll eventually grow but with every previous project you’ll see a glimpse of what’s to come. With the Hybrid there were certain songs that just stuck out that were newer to me doing, so I was learning that. I get bored quick. That’s why I take adderol (laughs).</span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span><strong>Your style is pretty abrasive, how’d you develop that style?</strong></span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span>Just being from Detroit, the whole open mic scene. When you only got 16 bars to get your point across, you’ve got to leave an impression.</span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span><strong>A lot of wild rappers like ODB are always respected but never considered for top 5 lists. You’re also a wild rapper with a song called “greatest rapper alive”, why shouldn’t people overlook you?</strong></span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span>At the end of the day, I gotta put the work out to back it up. Mothafuckas think Dave Chappelle crazy. All geniuses are crazy.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Probably.</strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>But if you look at what I’ve been doing, I’ve been doing what I want to. Ain’t no crazy co-signs, you know, I fucked with (Tony) Yayo and my peer group but I feel like I had an organic buzz. It was nothing really fake about what I’m doing. One thing with rappers is you either wanna be that person or you believe them.<strong></strong></span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Unlike a lot of these new rappers, you’re a big advocate of writing and taking care with your rhymes. How long does your writing process take?</strong></span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span>I would say they happen pretty quickly. it’s more so about how long it takes to do the song. The writing process takes a long time, I’ll rewrite a song about three or four times. It’ll take me about ten or fifteen minutes.<strong></strong></span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span><strong>The tracks come out sounding effortless, which song did you have a lot of difficulty with?</strong></span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span>I’d say that “Lincoln Contintental” song. They actually put it on the Hybrid itunes version. It took me 45 minutes just to do the adlibs (laughs).</span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span><strong>I think everybody wants to know but is afraid to ask, what happened to your front teeth?</strong></span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span>I got hit by a car. I was in middle school, the other one broke while playing basketball.</span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span><strong>Thought it might have been a fight or something.</strong></span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span>Nah, wrong place at the wrong time</span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span><strong>You get respect from cats like Sean Price who don’t usually associate with skinny jean rappers, can you explain why that is?</strong></span></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span><span>(Laughs) I mean at the end of the day, if you meet me and get to know me, appearances don’t really mean shit. I’m a hood ass nigga. I’m from the D (Detroit). I just don’t want to get put in any box. You see me next year, I’m going to look a whole different way. I keep changing.</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Wus7DOp2SipqSnvKXBwq2gqKZdma6vuthmmaunp6N6ta3LpKpmnp%2BkubR5xqijnWWRmbGmvsClo2aZnpl6uLTYZp%2Biq12YubDAx56qZpmimnp3g5RxbGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danielle-fishel-maxim-cover-girl-meets-world-star-topanga-shows-off-major-cleavage-in-sexy-lingerie-pictures-201383.html><span>←</span><span>Danielle Fishel Maxim Cover: Girl Meets World Star Topanga Shows Off Major Cleavage in Sexy Lingerie</span></a>
