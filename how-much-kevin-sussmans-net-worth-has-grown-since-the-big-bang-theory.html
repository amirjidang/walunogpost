But in 2022, he was playing three roles: cancer scam victim on Better Call Saul; Zac on Call Me Kat alongside his former co-star, Bialik; and his biggest role, Mark Roessler in Hulu's limited series, The Dropout. It's about the true story of the fraudulent Theranos founder, Elizabeth Holmes, played by Amanda Seyfried.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Rant's Joshua Kristian McCoy</a> raved about Sussman's performance in the show, saying: "Every passing set of headlights or ringing phone sets them off, it's akin to corporate horror. Watching them break down is simultaneously tragic and hugely cathartic when things turn their way."</p><p>Sussman most recently starred in Apple TV's Lesson in Chemistry, an adaptation of a best-selling novel by Bonnie Garmus, set in the 1960s. It's led by <strong><a href=#>MCU</a></strong> star, Brie Larson who plays Elizabeth Zotts — whose "dream of being a scientist is put on hold when she finds herself pregnant, alone and fired from her lab," per IMDb.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kevin-sussman-39-s-love-life-who-is-sussman-39-s-second-wife-addie-hall>Kevin Sussman's Love Life: Who Is Sussman's Second Wife, Addie Hall?</h2><h3 id=kevin-sussman-and-addie-hall-married-in-april-2023>Kevin Sussman and Addie Hall married in April 2023</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kevin-sussman-wedding-042123-1c83b4249d1c45eca2af66a2a433c9de.jpg><p>According to IMDb, Hall is credited for voicing Faye Miller on the animated flick, The Adventures of the Adventures 2: Denver Rocks.

But they quickly find themselves on a perilous new treasure hunt in the mountains of Colorado, from which they may never return."</p><p>Hall keeps a low profile. She's not on Instagram, unlike her husband who broke out the wedding news on the platform in April 2023.

Nayyar wrote in the comments, "Oh my gaaaawwwwwd! Love you brother." However, fans were quick to notice that he wasn't invited.</p><p>For the record, the ceremony looked pretty intimate (true to the couple's low-key nature). The pair went Instagram official as a couple on October 19, 2020. The Ugly Betty alum announced that they got engaged in March 2022, alongside a photo of them at Pastis in Manhattan's West Village.
