They tied the knot in July 2009 and welcomed their daughter, Everly, in May 2013.</p><p>While the pair became a beloved celebrity couple, Dewan admitted in February 2018 that they struggled like anyone else in a relationship. “We’ve always had the same values. But <a href=#>we’re not perfect</a>! Are you kidding?” she told Health magazine at the time. “We fight like other couples, we disagree about things, we have days where we don’t really like each other.”</p><p>Two months later, the <a href=#>duo announced their split via a joint statement</a> in April 2018. “We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple,” they wrote. “We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together. Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now. There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision — just two best friends realizing it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible. We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly.”</p><p>A source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time that <a href=#>Dewan and Tatum’s relationship “had turned more into a friendship,”</a> adding that “they were constantly traveling for work” and “there wasn’t any crazy drama or fighting.” A second insider revealed that she “gave him all the space he wanted” but “it became clear that he enjoyed being away,” which was not “good for their marriage.”</p><p>The Dear John actor and the Soundtrack alum did not waste time moving on. Us broke the news in October 2018 that <a href=#>he had been dating</a> <a href=#><strong>Jessie J</strong></a> for a couple of months, while a source confirmed later that month that <a href=#>Dewan was seeing</a> <a href=#><strong>Steve Kazee</strong></a>. Although <a href=#>Tatum and the “Price Tag” singer were together on and off</a> until April 2020, the Flirty Dancing host found something more permanent with the Tony winner. They <a href=#>got engaged</a> in February 2020 and <a href=#>welcomed son Callum the following month</a>.</p><p>Another <a href=#>step forward for Dewan and Tatum was filing for divorce</a>, which she did in October 2018. They were <a href=#>declared legally single</a> in November 2019 and <a href=#>agreed to 50/50 joint custody</a> in January 2020. They <a href=#>finalized their divorce</a> in February 2020.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While hammering out the details of their divorce, the former costars took their personal drama public on more than one occasion, with <a href=#>Tatum insulting his ex-wife after a troll compared her to Jessie J</a> and <a href=#>Dewan accidentally downplaying his role in their daughter’s first months</a> of life.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to revisit Tatum and Dewan’s ups and downs through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKmtzaegp59dqa61wcxmoZ6mnpZ6pbHWmqVmraCoeqK6w2abqK%2BeqHq1tNGorKCgXam1pnnYnpirq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./arnold-palmer-invitational-open-winners.html><span>←</span><span>Champion Golfers and Arnold Palmer Invitational winners</span></a>
