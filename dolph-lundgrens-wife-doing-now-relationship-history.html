While almost everyone agrees <a href=#>the first movie is the best in the series</a>, there are a lot of people who really enjoy Rocky IV as well.While there are a lot of reasons why a lot of people enjoy Rocky IV, one of the biggest is that Dolph Lundgren played a great villain in the film. As a result of how compelling Lundgren's Rocky IV performance was, he went on to become a movie star.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Sylvester Stallone Resents The Success Of The "Rocky" Films</a></span>Like most movie stars, Lundgren's fans eventually became interested in the action star's private life. As the biggest of his fans will likely already know, <a href=#>Lundgren has led a fascinating life</a> and is a lot more complicated than the most simplistic characters he's played.Unsurprisingly, Dolph Lundgren's dating life has been pretty interesting. In the past, Lundgren walked down the aisle which begs the question, what has happened to the women the action star has married?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-dolph-lundgren-s-first-wife>What Happened To Dolph Lundgren's First Wife?</h2><p>Throughout most of history, fans who wanted to know where they knew an actor from had two options, ask the other people in the room and rack their brains trying to figure it out. These days, however, fans can simply go online to find the answer to their question in minutes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone's Method Acting Landed Him In The Hospital</a></span></p><p>Given the fact that most people have an infinite amount of information available to them in their pocket at any given moment, it can be frustrating when the definitive answer to a question can't be found online.</p><p>Unfortunately for Dolph Lundgren's fans who are interested in his personal life, his marital history is debatable.</p><p>According to several websites including hollywoodmask.com and hollywoodlife.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lundgren married a woman named Peri Momm and they divorced shortly thereafter</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Those same reports say that Momm completely eschewed the spotlight so nothing is known about what she has been up to since divorcing Lundgren.</p><p>While it may be unsatisfying to not know what Lundgren's first wife is up to now, there is a fascinating twist in the story of the movie star's early-'90s marriage. After all, it seems entirely possible that Lundgren never married a woman named Peri Momm at all.</p><p>While several websites claim Dolph Lundgren got married in 1991, several others have no reference to that. Most notably, Wikipedia and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whosdatedwho.com both have no reference to Lundgren marrying a woman in 1991</a>.</p><p>Unless Lundgren confirms or denies he got married to Peri Momm in 1991, it seems like that will remain a mystery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-dolph-lundgren-s-wife-anette-qviberg>What Happened To Dolph Lundgren's Wife Anette Qviberg?</h2><p>Unlike the mystery of Dolph Lundgren's reported first marriage, there is no debating whether he walked down the aisle in 1994. After all, that was the year that Lundgren married a woman named Anette Qviberg.</p><p>After dating for just short of two months, Dolph Lundgren and Anette Qviberg got engaged. Together for a long time, the couple's marriage lasted just short of 17 years after they walked down the aisle.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Dolph Lundgren’s Youngest Daughter, Greta?</a></span></p><p>During Lundgren and Qviberg's many years together, they welcomed two daughters into the world. Born in 1996 and 2001 respectively, Ida and Greta Lundgren have both grown into interesting women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Lundgren and Qviberg divorced in 2011, the former couple has continued to get along quite well. In fact, <a href=#>Lundgren and Qviberg even vacationed in Marbella, Spain with their daughter Ida</a> in 2017.</p><p>On top of maintaining a positive relationship with her ex-husband, Qviberg is very active on Instagram. Thanks to Qviberg's Instagram bio, it is known that she is proud to be a "Mother of two" and an "ð Interior designer".</p><h2 id=who-has-dolph-lundgren-dated>Who Has Dolph Lundgren Dated?</h2><p>Since Dolph Lundgren became famous in 1985, he has only been single or married for a fraction of that time. During the rest of the time, Lundgren has been linked to several women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the women that Lundgren has been involved with over the years aren't well known today. On the other hand, Lundgren reportedly dated two memorable models in the past, Grace Jones and Janice Dickinson.</p><p>Most recently, Lundgren began dating a Norwegian personal trainer named Emma Krokdal and they got engaged in 2020. Unless something has changed and they haven't said anything about it, Lundgren and Krokdal remain together to this day.</p><p>When news broke that Lundgren and Krokdal were engaged, most people remarked on their age gap. The reason for that is Krokdal is a staggering 39 years younger than Lundgren.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqKSgnXqtwc2dnqudnqh6uLXFnmSdp5mjtG66zrBkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXZ22tMDOq7Bo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./watch-weeknds-weird-kiss-land-promo-video-178244.html><span>←</span><span>Watch The Weeknds Weird Kiss Land Promo Video</span></a>
