With over a decade of experience, Johnson is no doubt one of the best Nollywood can boast of.&nbsp; Here are facts about Adeniyi Johnson you should know.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=summary-of-adeniyi-johnsons-biography></span><b>Summary of Adeniyi Johnson’s Biography</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b>Adeniyi Johnson</li><li><b>Nickname: </b>Niyi</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Male</li><li><b>Date of birth: </b>27 February 1978</li><li><b>Adeniyi Johnson’s Age: </b>44 years old</li><li><b>Ethnicity: </b>Black</li><li><b>Nationality: </b>Nigerian</li><li><b>Sexual Orientation: S</b>traight</li><li><b>Religion: </b>Christianity</li><li><b>Marital Status: </b>Married</li><li><b>Adeniyi Johnson’s Wife: </b>Seyi Edun</li><li><b>Siblings: </b>Aderonke Victoria</li><li><b>Adeniyi Johnson’s Net worth: </b>$400,000</li><li><b>Famous for: </b>His acting and filmmaking career</li><li><b>Adeniyi Johnson’s Instagram: </b>@adeniyijohnson</li><li><b>Twitter: </b>@adeniyijohnsonn</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=44-years-old-adeniyi-johnson-hails-from-ondo-state-southwest-nigeria></span><strong>44 Years Old Adeniyi Johnson Hails from Ondo State, Southwest Nigeria</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born on 27 February 1978 and raised in the Ikotun community of Alimosho local government Lagos state, Niyi is an indigene of Ondo state. He was raised in a middle-class family, and though not much is known about his childhood years, the actor described his family as not rich but comfortable.</p><p>He stated that his parents never failed to supply him with the fundamental requirements of a growing youngster. Adeniyi Johnson was not an only child. He had a sister named Aderonke Victoria, who died in May 2018.</p><p>Academic-wise, Adeniyi had his basic and secondary education in Lagos, after which he gained admission to the Polytechnic of Ibadan to study mass communication. He, however, proceeded to the prestigious Lagos State University, where he graduated with a degree in history and international relations.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=adeniyi-began-acting-after-graduating-university></span><strong>Adeniyi Began Acting After Graduating University</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adeniyi Johnson’s love for acting began in his childhood years, and as he grew older, he joined his church drama group, where he gained some experience in acting. He pursued acting as a professional career after his university years.</p><p>To find a possible acting role, Niyi said he would go to the cyber café, where he would send emails to marketers indicating his interest in acting. While doing that, he enrolled at an acting school to perfect his acting skills. He also learned makeup, costume, production, directing, and management.</p><p>Adeniyi Johnson eventually got his first acting role as a prop for the popular Nigerian soap opera, Tinsel. At some point, he began receiving minor roles. But as one who wanted more for himself and his career, he sought platforms that would help him to better showcase his acting skills. Hence, he left Tinsel and made moves to do Yoruba movies.</p><p>Niyi’s first movie role was in Motaka Osi danu, a Yoruba movie produced by Lekan Ayinde. Lekan was actually the one who helped Niyi find his footing in the Nigerian movie industry. They both met at a soap opera location, and the producer encouraged him to try taking a role in the Yoruba movie.</p><p>After successfully carrying out his role in Motaka Osi danu, Niyi also got himself a role in yet another Yoruba film, Agbere. The 2011 movie saw him sharing the set with top Yoruba actors like Yomi Fash Lanso and Mosun Filani.</p><p>Adeniyi’s rise to fame in the movie industry came to fruition with the release of more best-selling Yoruba movies that featured him. However, the actor prefers to describe himself not just as a Yoruba actor but as a Nollywood actor, having played key roles in English-speaking films like Voiceless Scream, 77 Bullets, and Lugard.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=adeniyi-johnsons-movies-and-tv-shows-include></span><strong>Adeniyi Johnson’s Movies and TV Shows Include:</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>Meet the In-laws</li><li>Ori Ola</li><li>Blogger’s wife</li><li>Afopina,&nbsp;</li><li>Full House,&nbsp;</li><li>Motaka Osi danu</li><li>Magnetic Women</li><li>Ogo Mi</li><li>Omobolanle</li><li>Ori Ola,&nbsp;</li><li>Tinuke Adebayo</li><li>Lugard</li><li>Aadota Odun</li><li>Isonu Eku</li><li>77 Bullets</li><li>Pepeye</li><li>Voiceless,&nbsp;</li><li>Eta Oko</li><li>Ungrateful,</li><li>Play boy</li></ul><p>For his hard work and consistency in making good movies, Adeniyi Johnson has received several award recommendations. In 2018, the thespian received his first award when he became the winner of the City People Awards in the category of Best Supporting Actor of the Year (Yoruba).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=adeniyi-johnson-is-currently-seyi-eduns-husband></span><strong>Adeniyi Johnson Is Currently Seyi Edun’s Husband</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Making it to the limelight is not all that 44 years old Niyi Johnson is grateful for. His current marital success also is. He is married to Oluwaseyi Edun, a well-refined Nollywood actress whose rise to fame also came with a lot of hard work. No wonder why she is listed as one of the most sorts after talents in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Important details about Niyi and Seun’s first meeting cannot be found, but there were reports that they were seeing each other while the actor was still married to his first wife. Oluwaseyi Edun has, however, debunked the rumors, saying that her relationship with Adeniyi Johnson started after he divorced his wife.</p><p>Niyi specifically noted that he only started dating Seyi in May 2016, just a year after he broke up with his first wife. The new couple officially got married in 2018, and they are yet to welcome a child of their own.</p><p>The Ikotun-born actor said he was attracted by Seyi’s kindheartedness and resilience to see people around her do well. 7 years into their marriage, the couple seemed to be continuously soaked in each other’s love.</p><p>As actors, Niyi and Seyi have shared the set a couple of times. Seyi even revealed that her husband sometimes works on her movie productions, and she pays him double because working with him on set is “strictly business.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=adeniyi-johnson-was-previously-married-to-toyin-abraham></span><strong>Adeniyi Johnson was Previously Married to Toyin Abraham</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adeniyi’s first wife was Toyin Abraham, a popular Nollywood actress who also contributed to the growth of the industry through her hard work. The two got married in 2013, and they separated in 2015 following Toyin’s claim that Niyi was cheating on her with Seyi, his current wife.</p><p>There were also claims that the thespian tried to poison Toyin Abraham. Niyi has debunked the rumor, saying they were plots by his haters to diminish his image. Like her ex-husband, Toyin has also remarried. She got married to Kola Ajeyemi in 2019, and they welcomed their first child Ireoluwa Okikijesu Ajeyemi in the same year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yam56mma62brbOoaWsp55iwKbFyGacna2eqHqpwdKbmKecXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./whitney-houston-robyn-crawford-assistant-relationship-lesbian-affair.html><span>←</span><span>Whitney Houston's Relationship With Robyn Crawford Was More Complicated Than It Appeared</span></a>
