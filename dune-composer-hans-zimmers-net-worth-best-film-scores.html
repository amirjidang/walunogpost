Chances are that the actors will all command huge salaries in future films. Another Hollywood figure got rich from Dune: Part Two as well... but they worked behind the scenes. The legendary <strong>Hans Zimmer composed the <a href=#>music</a> for Dune</strong>, which added to his amazing net worth. In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>how much money Zimmer makes composing</strong>, along with what he said about writing the beautiful and compelling film score for Dune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-does-hans-zimmer-make-composing-film-scores-including-dune>How Much Money Does Hans Zimmer Make Composing Film Scores Including Dune?</h2><p>Hans Zimmer has a <strong>net worth of $200 million</strong>, according to Celebrity Net Worth, and he earns a fortune from every movie that he works on. According to Work.chron.com, Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, and John Williams can <strong>make $2 million for each movie</strong>. While it's unknown exactly how much Zimmer has earned from each film score, that seems to be the figure that is reported most often. It's definitely easy to see how all that money would add up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/hans-zimmer.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides composing the scores for Dune and Dune: Part Two, Zimmer worked on a range of movies such as The Dark Knight, No Time To Die, The Lion King, and Kung Fu Panda. His career is so interesting because he moves between genres and it seems like he can score any type of film. By the time he was hired to score Dune and the highly-anticipated sequel, he must have been able to charge a high rate since he is so beloved and legendary.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/patrick-stewart-hated-being-on-saturday-night-live-and-thought-he-was-one-of-the-worst-hosts-ever-front-deposit-back-snl_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Patrick Stewart Described His Time In Dune As "Hurtful" And "Discouraging"</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Patrick Stewart played Gurney in David Lynch's Dune.</span><p>While Hans Zimmer has made a fortune, it's important to note that <strong>other film composers don't make quite as much money</strong>. According to DIY Film Composer, a<strong> composer could earn $2,500 to $10,000 </strong>if they are hired to work on an independent movie with a low budget. A bigger movie might pay them between $35,000 and $300,000. If they work on a blockbuster film, their salary could increase to somewhere between $100,000 and $2 million.</p><p>Even though Zimmer's Dune and Dune: Part Two salaries are unknown, it seems likely that he was paid closer to the $2 million range for each movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>What Are Some Of Hans Zimmer's Most Notable Film Scores?</p></th><th scope=col><p>Release Date (According to IMDb)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Rain Man</p></td><td><p>1998</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Lion King</p></td><td><p>1994</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gladiator</p></td><td><p>2000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pearl Harbor</p></td><td><p>2001</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Inception</p></td><td><p>2010</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Interstellar</p></td><td><p>2014</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dunkirk</p></td><td><p>2016</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dune</p></td><td><p>2020</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Top Gun: Maverick</p></td><td><p>2022</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dune: Part Two</p></td><td><p>2024</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hans Zimmer has also made money from writing theme songs for TV shows.

In an interview with The Guardian in 2014, the composer said he wasn't embarrassed because he made money.
