He would also admit to <a href=#>breaking several times why shooting the film</a> because of his co-star, "Working with him was, I actually used to pride myself on the fact that I could not break in a scene, you could do or say anything. He turned it into an actual disability for me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"An entire movie could be cut of just me tearing up and trying to hold it together, and then standing at a perfect right angle for the rest of the scene because I can’t catch my breath. That was nice. That was really nice to work with that for a while, pretty soon it got embarrassing, I have to say."</p><p>Although he had a great time alongside Bateman, he might not be able to say the same for his scenes alongside Olivia Wilde.</p><h2 id=reynolds-forgot-his-lines-during-his-intimate-scene-with-wilde>Reynolds Forgot His Lines During His Intimate Scene With Wilde</h2><p>To Reynolds credit, he spared no detail back in 2011 when discussing this embarrassing on-set situation, when speaking to former late-night host Jay Leno. His scene alongside Wilde featured nudity and according to Reynolds, <a href=#>it made him lose sight of everything</a>, and that included his lines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So, in the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those pasties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” the actor explained.</p><p>“And I forget every line in the scene — not just from this movie but from every other movie I’ve done.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>This Was Ryan Reynolds' Highest Grossing Vs His Lowest Grossing Movie</a></span></p><p>Ryan admits at the moment, he felt like a teenage boy, completely uncomfortable.</p><p>As if forgetting his lines at the moment wasn't bad enough, things would take another turn when he had to touch his co-star. Let's just say the moment turned worse than just forgetting his lines...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=things-would-get-worse-during-the-same-scene>Things Would Get Worse During The Same Scene...</h2><p>The issues would continue as the scene progressed. Not only did he forget his lines but when it was time to touch his co-star, things got even worse. He was a sweaty mess and as he went in for contact, a certain sticker fell off his co-star, into his hands.</p><p>“I take my hands away and I look down at my hands and there are two frickin’ smiley faces on them and I have no idea what to do. The scene is over now. … And I reflexively, like an idiot, just put my hands right back on her breasts. And I think I’m doing it to cover them up, but I’m realizing now that it’s a very fine line between chivalry and, you know, workplace sexual assault.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reynolds admits he was doing his best to look away the entire time, in order to make things a little easier but as it turns out, it really didn't as his sweaty palms managed to erase the stickers.</p><p>It is a moment he'll truly never forget but at the very least, he was able to maintain a good attitude about it all, and in truth, it made for one heck of a hilarious story.</p><p>If Reynolds can break, it can truly happen to anyone.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds Gets Embarrassed By Jodie Comer In Hilarious Trailer Teasing ‘Free Guy’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqbWqv4ysmp6mlWK2r3nToZxmm5iWu6ixjK6nZq%2BRqHq0u4yupZynnZu8s8DAm6OeZZakv26%2B2JqlZqqVrruwuMOsZJqmlGK8rbXVophmr5mhsaZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-curb-your-enthusiasm-isnt-as-good-as-it-used-to-be-according-to-fans.html><span>←</span><span>Why 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' Isn't As Good As It Used To Be, According To Fans</span></a>
