In fact, people have paid so much attention to Hathway at times that some people have noticed something truly strange about her marriage to Adam Shulman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anne-hathaway-rsquo-s-dating-history>Anne Hathaway’s Dating History</h2><p>In the year 2001, Anne Hathaway became a star seemingly overnight when The Princess Diaries was released and became a big hit. In the twenty years since then, Hathaway has remained in the spotlight as a result of continuing to headline a slew of different movies and TV shows. Just like most of her peers, Hathaway’s star status has resulted in the tabloids paying <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a lot of attention to her love life.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Of Anne Hathaway’s Most Relatable Instagrams</a></span></p><p>The same year that Anne Hathaway rose to fame in 2001, the first rumor about her love life came to the forefront. According to some reports, Hathaway was involved with an actor named James Holzier in 2001 and 2002. According to other rumors, Hathaway and Topher Grace also were a thing from 1999 until 2001 before she really became famous. Later in 2002, it was reported that Hathaway was dating a restaurateur named Scott Sartiano who also notably was involved with Ashley Olsen and Jamie-Lynn Sigler at other times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After moving on from Scott Sartiano, Anne Hathaway wound up dating Hannibal actor Hugh Dancy from 2002 until 2004. From there, Hathaway got involved with a real estate developer named Raffaello Follieri from 2004 until 2008. In a shocking twist, Follieri wound up getting in big trouble after he was accused of misappropriating $50 million and after he took a plea deal, Raffaello was sentenced to four and a half years behind bars.</p><p>After she became single in 2008, Anne Hathaway began dating a man named Adam Shulman that same year. After getting engaged in 2011, Hathaway and Shulman walked down the aisle in 2012. Since then, Hathaway and Shulman’s family has grown in size as the couple welcomed their two children into the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-strange-fact-about-anne-hathaway-and-adam-shulman-rsquo-s-marriage>The Strange Fact About Anne Hathaway And Adam Shulman’s Marriage</h2><p>In the years since Anne Hathaway first rose to fame, many people have made a lot of assumptions about her background. With that in mind, it will likely come as a surprise to many of Hathaway’s fans that the famous actor actually was born in Brooklyn, New York. After her birth, Hathaway spent her first six years living in Brooklyn until her family moved to Millburn, New Jersey.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Things Got Awkward When Anne Hathaway Refused To Shake Hands With A Journalist</a></span></p><p>Even though Anne Hathaway has roots in New York and New Jersey, many people assume that her background is a lot more regal and fancy than that. Of course, part of the reason that people perceive her that way is due to the way Hathaway has always carried herself in public. However, it seems extremely likely that Hathaway’s name has something to do with the world’s perception of her. After all, the famous actor was named Anne Hathaway after William Shakespeare’s wife who had the same name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Adam Shulman began accompanying Anne Hathaway on the red carpet, most people’s main reaction was that the couple seemed happy together. Fortunately for them, there is no reason to think that Hathaway and Shulman have since become unhappy in their marriage. However, over the last several years, some very observant fans have become a lot more interested in another aspect of their marriage. The reason for that is people have noticed a truly mind-blowing coincidence about Hathaway and Shulman’s marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As eagle-eyed fans with expertise in literature history eventually figured out, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Shulman looks an awful lot like William Shakespeare</a>. Of course, given the fact that Anne Hathaway has the same name as the woman that Shakespeare married in 1582, that really is an amazing coincidence.</p><p>As anyone familiar with the internet should already know, sometimes a small group of people brings up something online and the media pretends that everyone is talking about it. When it comes to the fact that Anne Hathaway’s husband looks a lot like William Shakespeare, however, fans really have been talking about that for years on social media. In fact, so many people have brought up the resemblance that when Hathaway appeared on The View in 2019, she was asked about the situation. According to Hathaway, some people have even suggested that she and her husband may be Shakespeare and his wife reincarnated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp6aVYrWiwMearpqxXZ3CtK7Ap5tmmZSWum6%2FwqGspaWRo3qzscuaq6Knnqi1qryO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-nasfell-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-167463-html.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Nasfell Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
