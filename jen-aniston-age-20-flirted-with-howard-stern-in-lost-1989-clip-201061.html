In 1989 — long before Friends, Brad Pitt and all the rest — Jennifer Aniston was an unknown actress who'd just entered her 20s. To raise her profile, the Hollywood hopeful made an appearance on the Howard Stern Show as a &#34;NutriSystem success story.&#34; (She had recently lost 15 pounds on the diet plan, which was a sponsor of Stern's radio show.) Howard Stern and his crew replayed clips of that vintage appearance — one of the earliest featuring the future star — on The History of Howard Stern: Act III, a Sirius XM radio documentary series that looks back on Stern's life and career on radio."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

To raise her profile, the Hollywood hopeful made an appearance on the Howard Stern Show as a "NutriSystem success story." (She had recently lost 15 pounds on the diet plan, which was a sponsor of Stern's radio show.) <strong>Howard Stern</strong> and his crew replayed clips of that vintage appearance — one of the earliest featuring the future star — on The History of Howard Stern: Act III, a <a href=# rel=noopener>Sirius XM</a> radio documentary series that looks back on Stern's life and career on radio.</p><p>During her appearance, Aniston shyly talks about her skimpy acting resume. "I did a show [For Dear Life] at the Public Theater [in Manhattan]…I've only been in it [acting] a year professionally," she says after Stern teases her. ("You need help with your career, honey!")</p><p>Now famously fit, 1989's Aniston gabs about weighing 110 pounds after losing 15 in six weeks with NutriTrim. "I need maintenance now," she claims to Stern. Another weight-loss complaint? Her boobs. "Your breasts are so full!" Stern says. "No they're not," Aniston protests. "I've lost them completely!"</p><p>Stern takes an instant, typically lecherous liking to the up and comer. "You're very lovely," he praises, complimenting her outfit ("Shorts with those aerobic <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> and the big white socks") and her "very sensual pout."</p><p>Game for his flirting, Aniston avoids questions about when she lost her virginity ("oh my god!") but tells him she's a "big fan. big time!"</p><p>"Find me attractive?" Stern asks.</p><p>"Yeah, I do," she replies. "You look absolutely nothing like I thought you'd look." Suddenly embarrassed, she pleads, "My mother's listening to this, please!"</p><p>Aniston — who one day would pose semi nude on magazine covers, declines Stern's suggestions to pose nude for Playboy (or for a private sketch session).</p><p>"My god," Stern jokes. "There is a chipmunk in my undies."</p><p>By the end of the interview, Stern nearly forgets to ask her name. "What's your name?" he asks. "Jennifer," she replies.</p><p>"Jennifer Doody?" he asks.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Yeah, Jennifer Doody," she retorts, making a flatulent noise.</p><p>Aniston scored her first major role the following year in 1990 as harried sister Jeannie Bueller in the show Ferris Bueller — the TV adaptation of the hit 1986 film. The show ran for one season. She became a star as Rachel Green when Friends premiered in 1994.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ5irq%2B10q2mp2WRnLJufo9mnaWhoqmypXnWoquhZZikxKK%2Bw2aqrZ2io3qquoylpqysXWaGeYWMnKOiqF1nfXJ8lWpm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-garlin-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-183065-html.html><span>←</span><span>James Garlin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
