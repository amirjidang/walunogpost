Gregg Allman was born December 8, 1947 in Nashville, Tennessee. He is best known as a founding member of the Allman Brothers Band. He began his career in music as a teenager, playing in several groups with his older brother Duane before The Allman Brothers Band came to fruition in 1969. The band hit the charts in a big way in the early ’70s. Gregg Allman made the charts in 1986 as a solo artist with I’m No Angel. He was inducted, along with the band, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. When Allman was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame on September 16, 2006, he was introduced by Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue and performed Oncoming Traffic, Melissa and Georgia on My Mind solo and then ended with Midnight Rider backed by fellow inductees Bill Berry, Peter Buck and Mike Mills from R.E.M. at the Georgia World Congress Center. His distinctive voice placed him in 70th place in the Rolling Stone list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. Gregg Allman continues to work with The Allman Brothers Band, minus Duane Allman who lost his life in 1971 in a motorcycle accident in Macon, Georgia. Greg Allman died on May 27, 2017 at the age of 69.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fnL%2Bms8ZmmKWknZa7tHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5waKmoKqRpbW6ecWamq1lk5a%2FprHRZpiwmaKZwG6tzZ1kpaGWmnq0wM6rsGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-w-owings-iii-wife-was-george-w-owings-iii-married.html><span>←</span><span>George W.
