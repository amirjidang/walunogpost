With incentives, he can make up to $5 million in the upcoming 2020 season.</p><p>Mostert's old deal carried a base salary of just $5.575 million in 2020. His agent, Brett Tessler, claimed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mostert wanted a deal&nbsp;close to the&nbsp;</a>$4.55 million that teammate Tevin Coleman will make this season.</p><p>Ultimately, the 49ers decided to retain their lead running back who nearly guided them to a Super Bowl championship last season. Mostert, coming off his best season yet, can now focus on putting together another career year which could set himself up for a greater extension down the road.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 49ers backfield also includes Coleman and (whom the 49ers signed in free agency last year) Jerick McKinnon. They traded Matt Breida to the Miami Dolphins in the offseason, so keeping Mostert&nbsp;became that much more imperative.</p><p>Last season, Mostert finished with 772 rushing yards and eight touchdowns -- all career bests. He took his game to another level in the postseason, recording 336 total rushing yards and five touchdowns in the three contests.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Thomas & George Kittle Top "Madden 21" Wide Receiver, Tight End Ratings</a></strong></p><p>Mostert's dominance was especially on display in the NFC Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers. He finished with 220 rushing yards and four touchdowns, leading the 49ers to a 37-20 victory - and to their first Super Bowl appearance in seven years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 49ers kept most of their core together in the offseason. They lost standout pass rusher DeForest Buckner (traded to the Indianapolis Colts) and veteran wide receiver (signed with the New Orleans Saints in free agency), but GM John Lynch found suitable replacements at the draft in Javon Kinlaw and Brandon Aiyuk.</p><p>With the Mostert situation settled, the 49ers can now focus on the start of the 2020 season.</p><p><strong><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Boys Season 2 Teaser Shows Off Stormfront, The Seven's Newest Hero</a></span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6toqpGdsqa5jKamrKyVp8Furc2dZG1xlafAbr7ErKurrZOpwrOxjJymp6yilrC1ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oda-burud-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-58404-html.html><span>←</span><span>Oda Burud Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
