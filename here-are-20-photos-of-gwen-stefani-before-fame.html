Her unique style, voice and attitude have made her one of the biggest pop stars on the planet. From her humble beginning as a singer to being part of No Doubt and going onto pursue a solo career, Stefani has persevered through the tough times to enjoy the good ones. She has had a few changes in her look throughout the years, but the look that most people aren't familiar with her is the way she looked before she became famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We delved into the photo albums and found pictures of Gwen Stefani before she blew up all over the world.</p><h2 id=8th-grade><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>8th Grade</span></h2><p>This picture was taken when Stefani was in the 8th grade. That would mean the era was the early 80s. The short hair and the earrings made Stefani look like a sweet, innocent angel. She looks adorable in this picture, and the guy next to her looks like he provided her with plenty of laughs.</p><h2 id=1987><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>1987</span></h2><p>Stefani looked a lot like Kelly Clarkson when she was a teenager. Considering that she was born in 1969, that would mean Stefani was 18 years old in this picture. That's about the time one finishes high school and goes on to tertiary education. According to Famous People, Stefani attended Fullerton College before transferring to California State University.</p><h2 id=childhood-christmas><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Childhood Christmas</span></h2><p>There's nothing better than celebrating Christmas when you're a child. Your parents spoil you with gifts, and you pretty much don't have a single worry in the world. It's also the time of the year when you let your hair down and enjoy the time with family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=collector-s-edition><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Collector's Edition</span></h2><p>If you're a fan of No Doubt and want to get your hands on the memorabilia from their early days, then you'll be glad to know that there's a place you can go to get your hands on it. Charity Stars offers all kinds of goodies for No Doubt fans. This is a picture of their early days.</p><h2 id=high-school-portrait><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>High School Portrait</span></h2><p>Most people will agree that the best days of their lives were when they were in high school. We thought life&nbsp;was tough then, but we found out that adulthood holds a lot more responsibilities. One of the things that people cherish the most about their high school days is their portrait.</p><h2 id=performance><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Performance</span></h2><p>Everybody's got to start out somewhere. Like most musicians. Stefani started out singing at local bars. Back then, even she would've been surprised if somebody had told her that she would have been an international star. Well, that's exactly what happened. All big things start from something small.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=with-sting><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>With Sting</span></h2><p>Regardless of the industry you're striving to make it in, you have to have somebody to look up to. For Stefani, it was Sting that she admired before she was a break-out star. Sting looks so cool on his bike, and Stefani is thrilled to have her music icon's autograph. She looks thrilled.</p><h2 id=baseball-game><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Baseball Game</span></h2><p>What better way to spend your free days than watching baseball? When you're a teenager and have time on your hands, you're most likely to go to a baseball game. Stefani and her two friends looked like they had a lot of fun. The great thing about a baseball game is that it provides hours of fun.</p><h2 id=venturing-into-adulthood><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Venturing Into Adulthood</span></h2><p>It's not a surprise that Stefani had men around her since she was young. She's always been beautiful, and men had taken notice. What's there not to like about a blonde who has a beautiful face and body? She got even more attention once she blossomed out of the teenage years and into adulthood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cheerleader><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Cheerleader</span></h2><p>With this outfit, Stefani looks like a cheerleader. Considering she is extremely beautiful, it wouldn't be a surprise if she was. Even her name is on the shirt, and she tied her hair the way a cheerleader would. It seems that not much has changed regarding her body since she was young. It was fit then, and it's fit now.</p><h2 id=early-rise-to-fame><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Early Rise To Fame</span></h2><p>You can see from the photo that Stefani was young when it was captured and that this was at the time that No Doubt was only a few years into its formation. This is an interesting photo, which makes it look like the group is sitting on a rooftop. That's very creative.</p><h2 id=summertime-fun><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Summertime Fun</span></h2><p>When you're young and it's summer, there are so many things you want to do and places to explore. Stefani made sure that she had company when she was out and about during summer. Why not? Judging by the body language, it seems that these two were quite close.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=up-n-coming><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Up 'N Coming</span></h2><p>Who can remember that No Doubt was formed in 1986? Yeah, it's been that long. Although the band members don't perform together as No Doubt, most of them have remained friends. It's good to see that friendships last for many decades, especially when you're famous.</p><h2 id=with-tom-dumont><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>With Tom Dumont</span></h2><p>One of the members of No Doubt was Tom Dumont. He was the lead guitarist and friends with Stefani. On his birthday, Stefani posted a picture on Twitter of them when they were young. They looked so happy and have remained friends for a long time, which is always a good thing.</p><h2 id=golden-oldie><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Golden Oldie</span></h2><p>Although this picture is old, you can clearly see that it is Stefani. It's so old that it is in black and white. Nevertheless, she looked beautiful back then as she does today. It's nice to see her smiling, and she looked happy. With age, Stefani has only gotten more beautiful.</p><h2 id=beach-girl><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Beach Girl</span></h2><p>When Stefani started out, she wasn't headlining stages and selling out stadiums. Her beginnings were humble, but her perseverance paid off. When she started, she was performing gigs even on beaches. She looks like she had fun, not to mention that she looked beautiful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=early-days><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Early Days</span></h2><p>Hit singles such as Don't Speak and It's My Life propelled No Doubt to superstardom. They produced incredible songs, and it's unfortunate that they are no longer active. Considering that they were together since 1986, perhaps the band members felt that they needed a break.</p><h2 id=groupies><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Groupies</span></h2><p>This picture looks a bit erotic. Considering that Stefani is an absolute stunner, nobody could blame these guys if they were getting ideas about making a move. You can't blame Stefani for always having a lot of men around her since she has so much going for her.</p><h2 id=with-gavin-rossdale><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>With Gavin Rossdale</span></h2><p>With fame comes love. Sometimes it works out, and other times it ends. In the case of Stefani's marriage with Gavin Rossdale, it lasted from 2002 until 2016. Although it didn't work out, they did have children. Everything happens for a reason, and Stefani went on to have a relationship with Blake Shelton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=princess><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Princess</span></h2><p>Stefani looks absolutely adorable in this picture. One of the features that give it away that it's Gwen Stefani is her lips. She looked so cute as a little girl and blossomed into a beautiful, successful woman who is one of the biggest pop stars on the planet. Well done to her for all her achievements.</p><p>sources: thefamouspeople, charitystars</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVYq6zsYxrZ2aomKTBsL%2BMqJ1mn6eau26%2F056dmqaZYq%2Bmss6rnGaekaKycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./791955-figure-2-photo-watch-the-action-figure-recreation-of-asukas-shining-wizard-to-emma-on-nxt.html><span>←</span><span>Figure 2 Photo: Watch the Action Figure Recreation of Asukas Shining Wizard to Emma on NXT!</span></a>
