After acquiring the world’s largest yellow diamond and launching the Blue Book Collection catalog of ornate jewels, Tiffany also introduced the iconic blue branding that is used even today. The brand exploded in pop culture after the 1961 movie <a href=#><i>Breakfast At Tiffany’s</i>, starring Audrey Hepburn</a>, which boosted the company's sales. Ever since Elsa Peretti joined the firm in the 1970s, the brand has continued to create iconic and sophisticated pieces, popular among the elites.</p><p>As Hollywood’s favorite jeweler, Tiffany & Co. has created iconic pieces.
