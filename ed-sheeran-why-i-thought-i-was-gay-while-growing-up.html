As soon as we started dating my life kind of shifted to that,” he said. “She plays in a female hockey team [and] we hang out with them all the time. It’s very much like women empowerment.”</p><p>The <a href=#>“Perfect” musician</a> added that the birth of his daughter, Lyra, <a href=#>whom the couple welcomed in August 2020</a>, has only furthered the feminine influence in his world. “Before Lyra was born it was kind of [present] but now Lyra is born it’s even more [prevalent],” Sheeran concluded.</p><p>The Grammy winner and his wife, 29, have kept their family life somewhat private since becoming parents, but Sheeran has revealed <a href=#>what 14-month-old Lyra thinks of his music</a>.</p><p>“I’ll sing [my new songs] to my daughter, who’s not my biggest fan. She just cries,” he said during a May appearance on Radio 1’s Big Weekend. “No, I’ve got some she likes. She really likes ‘Shape of You.’ The marimba sound is good, but she doesn’t like anything loud or anything belt-y.”</p><p>Sheeran confirmed in September 2020 that Seaborn had given birth to their baby girl one month prior.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We are completely in love with her. Both mum and baby are doing amazing and we are on cloud nine over here,” he shared via Instagram at the time. “We hope that you can respect our privacy at this time. Lots of love and I’ll see you when it’s time to come back, Ed x.”</p><p>The “Afterglow” singer <a href=#>announced his engagement in January 2018</a>. After sparking marriage speculation on multiple occasions, the duo reportedly tied the knot in a private ceremony in December 2018 ahead of the holidays.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaenF2otaax0ZqlZq%2BYrnqqedOhpq6fmKl6qnnWmqpmn5Gueri0yKWcZp%2BipMSqusZmrKln</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deitrick-haddon-is-married-to-wife-dominique-mctyer-kids-534048-html.html><span>←</span><span>Deitrick Haddon is Married to Wife: Dominique Mctyer.
