There have been a few discussions and begging to be proven wrong subjects as of late, yet he has not been taken out from the post.</p><p>There have not been any immediate claims, yet Dejoy has himself said that they are exploring him on account of the mission commitments which were made by his private-area workers. Since he is a finance manager, the immense commitments he got from the private area may have appeared to be dubious by the Department of Justice.</p><p>In any case, they have not uncovered the genuine reasons yet. In fact, the FBI has not acknowledged that any examinations are going on. As per Meaww, Louis Dejoy’s total assets is relied upon to be somewhere near $110 million.</p><p>Matter of truth, he has more than $30 million worth of resources, and most of his total assets is the aftereffect of his business. Henceforth, His situation as the postmaster general is definitely not a significant supporter of his total assets.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The FBI is investigating Postmaster General Louis DeJoy in connection with campaign fundraising activity involving his former business, according to people familiar with the matter and a spokesman for DeJoy. <a href=#>https://t.co/5Wb5tH4OWn</a></p><p>— The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) <a href=#>June 3, 2021</a></p><p><br>Louis Dejoy is hitched to his significant other Aldona Zofia Wos.
