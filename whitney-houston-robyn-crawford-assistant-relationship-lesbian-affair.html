From the introduction of the music icon with her debut album in 1985, Crawford was right there by Houston's side, not just as an assistant but as her dearest friend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/whitney-houston-s-relationship-with-robyn-crawford-was-more-complicated-than-it-appeared.jpg><p>Over the next two decades, their bond was the topic of many tabloid headlines. Some wondered if their connection was deeper than friendship, but Houston always brushed off any romantic speculations during interviews.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whitney Houston Revealed Why She Hadn't Appeared On David Letterman's Late Show In 13 Years</a></span></p><p>After Houston's passing in 2012, the rumors still continued, even finding a place in documentaries like Whitney: Can I Be Me in 2017. But Crawford remained silent, keeping away from these discussions to respect Whitney's legacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It wasn't until her own 2019 memoir titled A Song for You: My Life with Whitney Houston, that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she gave her personal account of their relationship</a>, confirming their romantic involvement with each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/whitney-houston.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Their love story takes center stage in the biopic I Wanna Dance with Somebody</a>, featuring Naomi Ackie as Whitney Houston and Nafessa Williams as Robyn Crawford. Talking about her role as Crawford, Williams, who hasn't met her in person, shared with GLAAD, "I really approached this carefully and I want [her] to know that I just wanted to represent her in the best light."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robyn Crawford's 2019 memoir delves into their emotional and physical connection, revealing that their intimacy went beyond the surface. "You could tell Whitney and I were tight," Crawford expressed, "It wasn't all about our sleeping together."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/robyn-crawford.jpg><p>She went on: "We could be vulnerable. We could be genuine without hiding anything. We could entrust each other with our innermost secrets, our emotions, and our true selves. We were companions. We were partners. We meant the world to one another."</p><p>However, despite their desire to be together, Houston decided to end the physical aspect of their relationship early on, shortly after she signed a record deal with Clive Davis at Arista.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She told me we should stop being physical," Crawford recounted, "because it would complicate our journey even further ... She said that if people found out about us, they would use it against us. And in the '80s, that's exactly how it felt."</p><h2 id=when-did-whitney-houston-and-robyn-crawford-first-meet>When Did Whitney Houston And Robyn Crawford First Meet?</h2><p>Back in 1980, a special connection formed between Whitney Houston and Robyn Crawford at a summer camp in East Orange, New Jersey. Houston was 16 years old at the time and Crawford was 19. The pair remained close since their initial meeting as teenagers and maintained a solid relationship that lasted decades. They went from being professional coworkers to the best of friends, and even having a romantic relationship according to Crawford.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/whitney-houston-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Crawford shared how it all began that very first summer, she claimed that the pairs' relationship was of a romantic and intimate manner. But after two years, Whitney Houston made a tough call, opting to put an end to their relationship due to same-sex relationships not being as accepted in the 1980s.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella Originally Saw Whitney Houston As The Titular Character</a></span></p><p>Houston had just sealed a record deal, and the thought of receiving hate for her sexuality is suggested to be the main reason for her restraint. Crawford revealed, "She told me that if our secret got out, it could be turned against us. That's how it felt back in those '80s days."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/robyn-crawford-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nonetheless, their bond remained unbreakable over the next 22 years. Crawford remained a close and solid figure in Whitney's life, from her right hand to creative director and even co-manager of Nippy Inc., Houston’s company.</p><p>Crawford even had the honor of being maid of honor when Houston wed Bobby Brown. Their remarkable 22-year connection that stood the test of time.</p><h2 id=whitney-houston-39-s-family-did-not-accept-her-close-relationship-with-robyn-crawford>Whitney Houston's Family Did Not Accept Her Close Relationship With Robyn Crawford</h2><p>The 2019 documentary titled Whitney Houston explored the complex relationship between Houston's family and Crawford, uncovering hints of animosity toward Robyn Crawford that was implied to have been a mix of homophobia, envy, or perhaps both.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/whitney-houston-s-mom-was-furious-when-rumors-circulated-that-she-was-completely-broke-here-s-the-real-reason-why.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the film, Houston's older brother Gary wasn't mincing words: "Robyn was just a nobody, an opportunist," he stated firmly. Responding to claims that his family aimed to keep Crawford away from Houston, Gary explained, "I never actually witnessed any such thing, but I was sure she was someone I didn't want my sister to be involved with."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whitney Houston Might Have Been More Involved With Disney Than Fans Realized</a></span></p><p>Adding to this, Crawford unveiled in her memoir that Houston's mother, the gospel singer Cissy Houston put pressure on their relationship. "Whitney told me her mom believed that two women being that close wasn't natural," Crawford recounted, "but our bond was that strong."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the family dynamics, there were those within Houston's circle who backed their connection, notably her steadfast agent Nicole David, who considered Crawford an asset. "In my role as an agent, I'd approach Robyn, and she'd contribute to meetings," shared David about Crawford, who also played the role of the singer's creative director for a long time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/whitney-houston-and-cissy-houston-looking-happy-together.jpg><p>As Houston attempted to change her relationship with Crawford, the romantic aspects diminished and the pair instead maintained a close friendship.</p><p>Kevin Macdonald, the director of the Whitney documentary, highlighted, "By the time Whitney was becoming a sensation in the mid-'80s, their bond had already transformed into an incredibly close friendship."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to being Houston's creative director, assistant, and close friend, Crawford played a pivotal professional role. Yet, despite their promise to stand by each other, Crawford made the difficult decision to step away from Houston in 2000. She realized she couldn't shield Houston from her escalating battle with drug addiction and tumultuous marriage to Bobby Brown.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaGko7K6eceorKysn6N6s7vBsqVmm6KWxKe70Z1kmqujnsC1rc2tZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2hsrSuyJqlZpmWm66qvo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-she-say-kelly-rowland-one-my-beauty-icons-oprah-winfrey-65507.html><span>←</span><span>What She Say?
