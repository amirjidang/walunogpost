Meet His Brother Dan Levy On Twitter</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>People often think that Shawn Levy and Eugene Levy are related to one another. However, in reality, they both are unrelated to one another and the similarity is merely in their last name.</strong></p><p>Let’s find out more about Shawn’s personal life.</p><p>Shawn is without a doubt one of Hollywood’s most successful directors and has given projects, all of which are massive hits. Some of the hits he made are Free Guy, Stranger Things, and others. His recent movie The Adam Project has been highly praised.</p><p>From a young age, he was sure that he will make his future in the entertainment industry, so he attended Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in New York. After that, he also attended Yale and USC, where he studied courses related to film-making.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-shawn-levy-related-to-eugene-levy></span>Is Shawn Levy Related To Eugene Levy?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It is quite easy to mistakenly assume that Shawn and Eugene are related; however, there are not related in reality. The main reason people often mistake their relationship is because of their last name.</p><p>Not only did they share last names but also their nationality. Both of them are from Canada and are highly revered names in Hollywood. Shawn was born in Montreal but Eugene was from Hamilton.</p><p>The common thing they share is their love for movies. They enjoy all the aspect of this art form and has been able to show their talent through it. Shawn does acting, direction, and production; however, Eugene is more of an actor and comedian.</p><p>Shawn’s recent work Free Guy and The Adam Project is with Ryan Reynalds, so it looks like as a director, he is comfortable with him. Both projects have been a great success, and he is all set to direct the unnamed Deadpool movie.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shawn-levy-brother-and-parents-details-explored></span>Shawn Levy Brother And Parents Details Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Another mistake people often make is they assume Dan Levy is Shawn Levy’s brother. Nonetheless, that is also false because they are not related to one another. Dan is Eugene’s son.</p><p>Dan is also a very successful actor, who has been loved in his hit shows like Schitt’s Creek, where he acted alongside Shwan, his real father. Since Eugene and Shwan are unrelated, certainly, Dan is also not related to Shawn.</p><p>There is no information about his parents; however, it has been revealed that he comes from a Jewish Family settled in Montreal. His parents gave him freedom from his childhood and promoted his creativity, which is evident in his various directions.</p><p>He is a happily married man and has three kids. His wife is Serena Levy. The couple can be seen together having a good time. His wife can be seen often in the premiere of his movies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYsCprdanZKWdpq56s7HLmquenF2pvG6x1KCcp51dobK3xYymnJ6sXZ22tHnBq6atoJWneqWtzWajnq6pYryvecOopJqhnpSDcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./iam-tongi-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>IAM Tongi Net Worth How Much is IAM Tongi Worth?</span></a>
