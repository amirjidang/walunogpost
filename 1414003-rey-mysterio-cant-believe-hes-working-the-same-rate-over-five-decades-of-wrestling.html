When you look at it that way, I started in 89. 80’s, 90’s, 2000’s, 2010’s, 2020’s. So it’s really amazing that the fact that God has given me still the blessing to continue doing what I love to do and that my body is holding up. And not beat up… just holding up, feeling good. Still being able to perform. But it is shocking to me at times when this question is brought up. I can’t believe that I’m still going at this rate. But it feels good. And I still feel the need to step in the ring because I love it,” Rey Mysterio said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-putting-it-in-perspective>Putting It In Perspective</h2><p>While speaking in the same interview, Rey Mysterio also mentioned that he is blessed to be able to wrestle<a href=#> with and against his son Dominik Mysterio</a>.</p><p>“Putting all that in perspective just gives you the sense of, ‘Wow I can’t believe that I’ve been able to live through all of that and still continue going.’ Not only that, to have been able to father my kid, and now see him pursue his career and share two years in the ring,” Rey Mysterio explained, “by his side and now against him. There’s so many things that have happened in my career that are a true blessing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqa2loY2K%2FpsWMprCsrJWntrB5wpqlrWWSmrmqsdWeZKGdo2LEsL7KoqWgZaSdsm6%2FwKacZqqRqbJuu9WeqWaemauybrDEnJidnaNivKd51qucrKycnruo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reese-witherspoon-actress-wiki-bio-age-height-weight-married-husband-children-net-worth-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Reese Witherspoon (Actress) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Married, Husband, Children, Net Worth, F</span></a>
