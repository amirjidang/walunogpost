The coming-of-age drama, which was created by <strong>Neal Marlens</strong> and <strong>Carol Black</strong>, followed Kevin Arnold (Savage), a teenager growing up in a suburban middle-class family in the late 1960s and early 1970s. McKellar portrayed Winnie, Kevin’s main love interest and neighbor.</p><p class=x_x_p3>The show was an instant hit, even earning a <a href=#>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy</a> in 1988. Following the series finale, however, McKellar took a step back from acting&nbsp;in order to figure out who she was outside of the entertainment industry — leading her to a career as a mathematician.<span class=x_x_Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=x_x_p3>“I needed to find out how I was valuable outside of Winnie Cooper, <a href=#>and math was challenging and I did well at it</a>,” the California native explained. “And I love this feeling that my value, the important stuff had nothing to do with how I looked or television.”</p><p>The West Wing alum <a href=#>has since returned to Hollywood</a>, landing lead roles in various Lifetime and Hallmark films and voicing Judy Jetson on The Jetsons since 2017. She’s also participated in season 18 of <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>, where she nabbed sixth place with partner <a href=#><strong>Val Chmerkovskiy</strong></a>. In 2014, the California native tied the knot with <a href=#><strong>Scott Sveslosky</strong></a> after two years of dating.</p><p class=x_x_p3>McKellar’s&nbsp;desire to encourage young girls to investigate mathematics, however, has yet to fade. The Domino Masters judge has written 11 children’s books over the years.<span class=x_x_Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=x_x_p3>“Math can be cool,” she gushed to <a href=#>USA Today</a> in August 2018. “I also [include] stories of my own personal struggles with math and ordinary, everyday life, to let girls realize we’re all the same. We all have the same worries, struggles, insecurities, etcetera.”</p><p class=x_x_p3>Despite her break from Hollywood, McKellar told son Draco, whom she shares with ex-husband <strong>Mike Verta</strong><b>,&nbsp;</b>that if he decides to follow in her footsteps, she would approve.<span class=x_x_Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=x_x_p3>“I will support you whatever you wanna do,” the <a href=#>GAC</a> star told her son during their ET interview. “I would put you in acting classes and I would help guide you through it.”</p><p class=x_x_p3>She added, “I’m not gonna ever push you in that direction [though], because&nbsp;it’s a tough life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZ6esKJ5zJyinqSclr9uvsSvnJqko2LAqbGMqqyirF2WsLW1zaBkraddm7avsIyhnKtlppa5trGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dallas-wings-does-veronica-burton-have-a-boyfriend-meet-her-parents-and-family-289628-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dallas Wings: Does Veronica Burton Have A Boyfriend?
