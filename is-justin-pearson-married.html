Who Is His Wife?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Supporters are frequently want to know that is Justin Pearson married to Ocean Gilliam after they saw her always by his side.</p><p>Justin Pearson, the musician and record label founder, has not tied the knot yet, but he is currently engaged to his longtime partner Oceana Gillian.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the exact duration of their engagement remains undisclosed, the couple seems to be going strong.&nbsp;</p><p>They prefer to keep their <a href=#>relationship</a> under wraps and have not shared much about their personal life with the media.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite their privacy, Justin and Oceana seem to be happy together and eagerly looking forward to their future. Justin Pearson has never publicly announced his marital status, leaving fans to speculate is Justin Pearson married.</p><p>In the starting week of April 2023, a couple of Democratic members of the Tennessee House of Representatives, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, who both belong to black ethnicity, were expelled due to backing gun control protestors following the March 27, 2023, assassination of three staff members and three students at a Nashville school.</p><p>However, their colleague, a 60-year-old white woman, Gloria Johnson, retained the seat. It quickly became the reason that Jones and Pearson were only kicked out due to their skin color.</p><p>Furthermore, Jones and Pearson, who represent Districts 52 and 86, were reinstated a few days after the Tennessee GOP was given flack for the men’s expulsions.</p><p>Pearson saint in a speech after regaining his seat back, <strong>“They tried to kill democracy. They tried to expel the people’s choice and the people’s vote. And they awakened a sleeping giant.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Justin Pearson married? Who is his future wife, Oceana Gilliam?</h2><p>Fans and followers often wonder about Is Justin Pearson married, but there is no evidence to suggest that he has.</p><p>According to the bio of Ocean, the Center for Justice Innovation’s website, Justin Pearson fiance, Oceana Gilliam, is a senior program manager for the Center for Court Innovation’s West Coast Initiative Team.</p><p>Much like her future husband, she is advocating for change. Her bio stated that Oceana is passionate about creating equitable programs to help develop healthier and thriving communities.</p><p>She aims to honor her mother, <a href=#>family</a>, <a href=#>community</a>, and ancestors through her work.</p><p>Oceana was born and raised in South Central Loss Angeles’ Crenshaw District. She completed her B.A. in political science and Russian degree from Beloit College and also received a Master of Public Policy degree from the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs.</p><p>To highlight just one of her many campaigns of change, she created and oversaw a program in 2020 that distributed over seventeen thousand packets of locally grown produce and food to South Loss Angeles families to manage food uncertainty caused by the <a href=#>COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p><p>However, there is very less information available about her relationship with Pearson, but it is clear that she always has his back.</p><p>After Oceana’s fiance supported gun control protesters before his expulsion, Mother Jones spoke with her about Pearson’s future in the Tennessee House of Representatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Justine Pearson future wife, said that she expected him to get excluded based on what she noted throughout his duration in Congress.</p><p>She told the outlet in a video that she had not observed any recent democratic actions from them.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Oceana Gillian, Rep. Justin Person’s fiancé, tells <a href=#>@garrison_hayes</a> she expects him to be expelled. What happens next? “We’ll keep fighting.”<br>Reporting from the gallery of the TN Capitol. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SLe1pLRA90</a></p>— Mother Jones (@MotherJones) <a href=#>April 6, 2023</a><p>She had seen Justin raise his hand during the welcoming and honoring portions of the session, but he was not acknowledged. Justin is regularly treated disrespectfully in this situation.</p><p>Furthermore, she added, <strong>“It honestly hurts my heart because he worked so hard to get here.”</strong></p><p>After witnessing her video talk with Mother Jones, Pearson retweeted it and shared some adorable words about his future wife.</p><p>In the tweet, he expressed gratitude towards his fiance for her efforts in fighting with people and striving to make justice possible in Tennessee.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thanks to my beautiful fiancé for fighting with the people and working to make justice possible in Tennessee. It’s time to do something about gun violence and to fight for our communities that are suffering. We WILL Keep fighting!! <a href=#>https://t.co/LcGs8AT17V</a></p>— Justin J. Pearson (@Justinjpearson) <a href=#>April 6, 2023</a><p>Pearson stated that it was time to take action against gun violence and work towards improving the conditions of suffering communities. He affirmed their commitment to continuing the fight.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Expelled Justin Pearson returned to the Tennessee House after a unanimous vote</h2><p>The second Black Democrat, who was one of the two lawmakers expelled from the Republican-controlled Tennessee House of Representatives due to their involvement in a gun control protest, returned to work at the Capitol a week after their expulsion.&nbsp;</p><p>This event gained national attention, and the other expelled lawmaker had already returned to work earlier.</p><p>Pearson, a lawmaker and state representative from Memphis, took the oath on Thursday outside the statehouse in Nashville,</p><p>The day before, Shelby County commissioners had unanimously voted to reinstate him after an expulsion he, his colleague-expelled lawmaker Justin Jones and others have denounced as motivated by racism.</p><p>Pearson said on Thursday morning, April 13, 2023, as he signed paperwork for his return, <strong>“Yes indeed, happy resurrection day,”</strong></p><p>He also communicated words during a blazing speech outside the Capitol after he was sworn in and before going back to the house floor.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>WATCH: <a href=#>@Justinjpearson</a> after being reinstated, “They tried to kill democracy, they tried to expel the people’s choice and the people’s vote…and they awakened a sleeping giant!”</p><p>Young leaders and voters made this happen. A powerful moment of history to watch. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WpXrrBxtZS</a></p>— Kaivan Shroff (@KaivanShroff) <a href=#>April 12, 2023</a><p>Pearson said that there would be a new building constructed, with a foundation based on love, pillars of justice rising up, and rafters of courage covering them.&nbsp;</p><p>He also mentioned that the doors of this building would be open to everyone in the state of Tennessee, regardless of their <a href=#>wealth</a>, s*xual orientation, or political affiliation.</p><p><a href=#>Kamala Harris</a> and <a href=#>Joe Biden</a> had forcefully criticized the representatives’ expulsion.</p><p>Before Rearson returned to the house floor, lawmakers applauded and cheered as the police officers were honored in the chamber in order to respond to the <a href=#>March 27 mass assassination at a Nashville elementary school</a>. This incident prompted the gun control protest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Nashville-shooting-incident-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Justin Pearson father & what was his reaction to his son’s expulsion?</h2><p>Justin Pearson father, Reverend Jason Pearson, was a preacher, and his mother, Kimberly Owens-Pearson, was a teacher. He was born in Memphis, Tennessee.</p><p>When Pearson was just 11 years old, his family relocated to Washington, D.C., while his father continued a master’s degree from Howard University. After four years, the family shifted back to Memphis.</p><p>After Jason’s son was expelled from the State House for demanding gun reform less than a week ago, he would now be marching back to Nashville on behalf of District 86 after a vote was cast to reappoint Justin at Shelby County Commission.</p><p>But Justin Pearson family said that their son had been a change-maker long before his time in the Tennessee State legislature.</p><p>Pearson’s parents said the essential principle they taught him was to be of service to others.</p><p>His mother, Kimberly Owens-Pearson, said, <strong>“He’s been fighting for his community way before the world knew his name.”</strong></p><p>They also said that they realized Justin was an orator when he was in elementary school and opted that he wanted to compete for his class president.</p><p>Justin’s father said that his son’s speech moved teachers to tears, and that was the day Jason realized that they had something special in his proud family.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC10mahrquknrtuvMSaqaynnmK6or7RopydZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-want-to-draw-a-cat-for-you-shark-tank.html><span>←</span><span>I Want to Draw a Cat for You Shark Tank Founder, Net Worth and Investment</span></a>
