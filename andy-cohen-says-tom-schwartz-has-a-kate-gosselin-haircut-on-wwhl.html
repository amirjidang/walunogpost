I have very, very thick hair, so it’s not going to work for everybody. My hairstylist gets calls from all across the country.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=s1>Gosselin went on to ditch the cut when she competed on Dancing With the Stars in March 2010, unveiling shoulder-length extensions. She’s since sported much longer hair but has maintained the bright blonde color.</span></p><p></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Schwartz, meanwhile, has also undergone a number of hair transformations.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Prior to his shaggy combover, the Bravo personality briefly rocked a platinum blond mane. In August, Schwartz caught Us off guard when he posed for a photo with a fan in Los Angeles, rocking icy tresses.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Schwartz officially unveiled the makeover on August 21, sharing an Instagram carousel of snaps with pal <strong>Jo Wenberg</strong> at a hair salon. “Hit me with the Draco Malfoy,” he captioned the social media post, referencing the Harry Potter character’s bright blond crown.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Andy-Cohen-Says-Tom-Schwartzs-Hair-Looks-Like-Kate-Gosselins-Inline-02.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>The big change caught the eye of Schwartz’s ex-wife, <strong>Katie Maloney</strong>, who wrote, “Oh boy,” in the comments section.
