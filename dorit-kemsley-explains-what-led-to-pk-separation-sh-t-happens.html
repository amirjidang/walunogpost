We have had our struggles over the last few years and continue to work through them as two people who love each other and share two amazing children together,” they wrote in a <a href=#>joint Instagram upload</a>, referring to son Jagger, 10, and daughter Phoenix, 8. “To safeguard our deep friendship and maintain a harmonious environment for our children we have made the mutual and difficult decision to take some time apart and reevaluate our relationship while we prioritize our children.”</p><p class=p1>They concluded, “We appreciate your love and support while we continue to do the work necessary throughout this journey.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Real-Housewives-of-Beverly-Hills-Star-Dorit-Kemsley-Explains-PK-Separation-inline-02.jpg><p class=p1>During Dorit’s <i>RHOBH </i>tenure, fans (and costar <strong>Erika Jayne</strong>) have speculated that her marriage was on the rocks.

But I’ve also gone through a lot of challenging things personally. So, you know, that’s where we are. But, I think we’re definitely good.”</p><p class=p1>Dorit further told <i>Us </i>that the now-estranged couple would “be good” moving forward.</p><p class=p1>“We’re both hopeful,” Dorit asserted at the time. “And, you know, everything is fine.

As Dorit continued to battle PTSD stemming from her 2021 home invasion, PK downplayed her mental health struggles.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“There are elements that I understand, there are also elements that I don’t consider are PTSD. I don’t,” PK told the couple’s therapist in a January episode. “The reality is, when does high maintenance blend with PTSD?”</p><p class=p1>PK also continued to schedule work trips out of town, which even meant skipping Mother’s Day in 2023.</p><p class=p1>“I’m your children’s mother. I would like you to make a concerted effort,” she later told PK in a February episode. “From now on, to be together on Mother’s Day because it is important to me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadp6KewW63xKaqpZ2pYrK5vMuaoKerXay1osCMpZydZaSkerG3jKycqZmilsGqu81mqqFlpGK1orzPnqWsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./don-gummer-bio-age-art-education-net-worth-wife-children-meryl-streep-and-sculptures.html><span>←</span><span>Don Gummer Bio, Age, Art, Education, Net Worth, Wife, Children, Meryl Streep and Sculptures</span></a>
