The SKIMS founder recently <a href=#>revealed she’s open to leaving reality T.V.</a> for a full-time career as a lawyer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I would be just as happy being an attorney full time," she revealed while speaking at the TIME100 Summit on Tuesday.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ben Affleck & Matt Damon Were Broke Together After ‘Good Will Hunting’</a></span></p><p>"The journey just really opened up my eyes so much," Kim continued "It gets overwhelming because there's so much to be done ... I brought my sister Khloé [Kardashian] to a prison for the first time last week, and that was really eye-opening for her."</p><p>Kim went on to share her hope that being a lawyer would be her “life’s most meaningful work.”</p><p>"I hope so," she added. "I always joke with my mom — who's my manager — I say Kim K. is retiring, and I'm just going to be an attorney."</p><p>Kim first began her activism for prison reform in October 2017, when she began bringing attention to the case of Alice Marie Johnson, who was convicted for coordinating communications in a drug trafficking case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to the attention Kim helped bring to the case, Alice was released from prison in 2020.</p><p>Kim revealed her plans to complete law school in 2019, which would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her father, Rob Kardashian, who famously represented OJ Simpson.</p><p>The reality star passed the first-year law students examination (often referred to as the “baby bar”) in December 2021, and she’s continuing on with her studies to this day.</p><p>“First year of law school, you have to cover three subjects: criminal law, torts, and contracts,” <a href=#>Kim previously told Vogue</a> of her law school experience. “To me, torts is the most confusing, contracts the most boring, and crim law I can do in my sleep. Took my first test, I got a 100. Super easy for me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The reading is what really gets me,” she went on. “It’s so time-consuming. The concepts I grasp in two seconds.”</p><p>Kim may have a while to go before she’s a full-fledged lawyer, but by her own admission, her days on reality television may be numbered once she gets her license.</p><p>That means Kim is also ready to give up a pretty hefty paycheck. While she likely makes the majority of her income from her businesses, like Skims, <a href=#>Kim was reportedly making $4.5 million per season</a> of Keeping Up with the Kardashians before it ended in 2021. It’s likely she’s making even more for her family’s new Hulu show The Kardashians. But with a billion-dollar net worth, money likely isn’t the first concern on Kim’s mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Morgan Wallen Sued By Fan After Cancelling Concert Due To Sickness</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Parade</a>, <a href=#>Vogue</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4qrmMpJirnJGotaqtzWaqmrGjYsCpscNmnqKulWLCsXnRnpiloaSuerV51WarqGWSmnqiecWuo6VlpJ66pnnLmq6ynaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-pregnant-baby-2-351227.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian And Kanye West Are Expecting Baby No. 2</span></a>
