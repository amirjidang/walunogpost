Stanley passed away in 2005, but he still lives on Adam's Happy Madison logo, where the man in the picture is the actor's father.</p><p>At the age of 6, Adam and his family relocated from Brooklyn to Manchester, New Hampshire, and while enrolled in his studies, the future star wasn't an outstanding student. Indeed, he was a notorious class clown.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drew Barrymore And Adam Sandler Discuss ‘Triangle’ With Jennifer Aniston</a></span></p><p>Outside of class, he took an interest in sports as well as watching professional wrestling. Throughout his childhood, he also picked up another town that would help him in his career. Sandler was good at playing music and writing songs (mainly goofy ones).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His favorite baseball team was the New York Yankees, and his favorite music growing up was Van Halen, The Police, and Styx. But his most remarkable talent of them all was his knack to make people laugh. His brother Scott was blown away that it came to him so easy, didn't have to put any work in it to have a whole house laughing.</p><h2 id=the-beginning-of-his-career>The Beginning of his Career</h2><p>Adam attended Manchester Central High School, and there he played on the varsity basketball team. Finally, he listened to his brother's persistence that he should try performing at a comedy club, so he took the stage at Boston Club.</p><p>From there, Sandler became addicted to his love for performance while basketball was put on hold. Adam got accepted to the prestigious New York University Tisch School of the Arts, where he studied fine arts and drama.</p><p>While enrolled in this class, he also picked up his first acting job as Smitty on The Cosby Show. He graduated in 88 and spent his free time doing more stand-up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jump-to-stardom>Jump to Stardom</h2><p>Never being so young, working on the comedy circuit, Adam Sandler was doing remarkably well. He caught the attention of Colin Quinn as well as Dennis Miller. In 1989 he started his first film Going Overboard, and then was Miller, who recommended Adam to Lorne Michaels to work on Saturday Night Live.</p><p>Outside SNL, his career was picking up starring in Coneheads as well as Airheads. He also starred in Billy Madison, a movie made on a budget of 10 million dollars and would go on to earn 26.4 million worldwide. Adam followed with Happy Gilmore, which earned a whopping 41.2 million made on a budget of 20 million dollars.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Sandler, Kevin James, And Friends From ‘Hubie Halloween’ Name Imaginary ‘Black Lagoon Baby’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He followed that with The Weeding Singer, which turned an 18-million-dollar budget into 123.3 million worldwide. With all the success, Adam decided to start up his own production company, Happy Madison, to make the movies he wanted to and help out a few of his paths. The first was Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo starring Rob Schneider. Then there was Little Nicky following and The Animal.</p><p>Adam Sandler has since gone on to solidify himself as one of the biggest names in Hollywood. However, the actor has picked up a ridiculous amount of Golden Raspberry Awards for Best Actor and the worst film.</p><h2 id=adam-sandler-s-is-very-generous-with-his-friends>Adam Sandler's is Very Generous with his Friends</h2><p>With a budget of $80 million, Grown Ups earned $271.4 million. Happy with the movie's success, Adam Sandler gave each of his friends and co-stars Chris Rock, David Spade, Rob Schneider, and Kevin James <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a brand-new $200,000 Maserati</a>, equating to roughly $800,000.</p><p>According to&nbsp;CheatSheet Rock said, "I went outside the other day, and I had a new Maserati in the driveway. Now I think that I'm Adam Sandler's b****."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the sequel, Grown Ups 2 was hated by the critics, it did well financially, earning USD 247 million with a budget of 80 million USD. Of course, a significant part of the cake went for the main cast and Sandler's buddies.</p><h2 id=he-always-pays-for-dinner>He Always Pays For Dinner</h2><p>In an interview with The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, David Spade described Adam Sandler as a nice guy pretty generous with his wallet, always paying dinner for him and the cast members of Grown Ups.</p><p>However, when Spade realized that Sandler was in the same fancy restaurant, he approached his friend and offered to pay for his dinner for him. To his surprise, Adam Sandler's $9,000 dinner was too expensive. Still, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he decided to charge the bills to his card</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-highest-grossing-adam-sandler-movie-of-all-time>The Highest-Grossing Adam Sandler Movie of All-Time</h2><p>Hotel Transylvania earned $358 million worldwide against a budget of $85 million. Hollywood's biggest names star in the animated monster movie. It's about Count Dracula, an overprotective dad that wants to keep his daughter from falling in love with a human. Adam Sandler is the voice of Dracula while Selena Gomez plays Mavis, the vampire daughter.</p><p>With his background as a king of comedy in the 90s, the audience cannot ignore Sandler and his talent. Despite <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Sandler's Net Worth is an estimated $420 million</a>, it is clear that the main reason his friends stick around and support him in every project is because of his kind heart.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameron Diaz: From Actress To Business Woman</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydpp6rXZaxormMrJinnJyav268wLJkoaGjYrOztcSnm6xlpKR6orzPnpirZZmjeqm10madoqSdqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./grace-karin-pants-amazon-colors-high-waisted-paper-bag-pockets-versatile.html><span>←</span><span>Grace Karin Pants With Over 1,000 Reviews Come in So Many Colors</span></a>
