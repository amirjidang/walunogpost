Unless it’s paid.”</p><p>He continued, “And thank you to the glam team who always gets tagged no matter what. (this post has nothing to do with me as Kylie only wears something from me once a year and I’m lucky if I get a decent pic to post. No shade to any of her team who styles her and no shame to the glam team . Even though we know you can not wait to unfollow me and drag me for filth!”</p><p>And that’s not all. “But it’s sad that designers work so so so so hard on these opportunities to dress these gorgeous popular women and they only tag the major high end designers like Oliver but forget about the other ones. ( this has nothing to do with my brand ) but it definitely has a lot to do with the la designers why not tag at least one ? Not all the time but maybe once in a while.”</p><p>The designer’s comment has since amassed close to 2,000 likes. Some social media users have praised Costello’s bold comment, while others are defending Jenner.</p><p>“Why are you being so entitled?” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one person</a> commented. “She purchased the dress and if she tags you or not doesn’t matter, just be happy and move on. Doing things this way is not it!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another person</a> who sided with Costello wrote, “if this isn’t real af. I don’t know what is 🤷🏼‍♀️.”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6DGrbXEZqGepp6av7R5kWypnWWSnr%2B1tMOasGacoprAtHnPqKqtZaOhrq65xJ1km7FdoraktMCeo2abn6jBprjLqGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kourtney-schenk-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-127018-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kourtney Schenk Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
