The show was messed up in a lot of ways, but it was done so well that people are still obsessed with it, though the series ended (though maybe not forever) in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the central storyline revolves around twins Dipper and Mabel, Wendy Corduroy was equal parts second-string character and plot device. So who was the actress behind her?</p><h2 id=how-old-was-wendy-in-39-gravity-falls-39>How Old Was Wendy In 'Gravity Falls'?</h2><p>When the series debuted, Wendy of 'Gravity Falls' was meant to be a teenager. Her age is stated as 15, which is just a smidge too old for Dipper, who harbors a secret and massive crush on her for a long time before he finally confesses.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebs You Didn't Know Voiced Disney Characters</a></span></p><p>And while Disney often uses child voice actors for kids' roles, this time, they did something a little different. The person who voiced Wendy in 'Gravity Falls' was super experienced so a great fit for the series, but she wasn't exactly in the right age group to portray a teenager in high school.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-voiced-wendy-on-39-gravity-falls-39>Who Voiced Wendy On 'Gravity Falls'?</h2><p>If she sounded just a little too mature for her age, there's a reason for that; Wendy Corduroy was voiced by Linda Cardellini. While Wendy was meant to be a teen just out of the elementary-age Dipper's social circle, Linda is in her 40s but clearly has the youthful voice that just about every animated series showrunner wants for their lineup.</p><p>What's really funny about the show is that although it was aimed at school-age kids on Disney, it did appeal to a wide range of ages. Part of the reason for that? The fact that the showrunner himself is in his 30s, and the series wanted to do something unique that other shows weren't.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And that also meant Alex Hirsch, the creator and voice of Stan Pines (and Bill Cipher) was the youngest recurring cast member. Dipper, Mabel, and Wendy were all voiced by people already in their 30s at the time the show premiered.</p><p>Fans can't argue with the fact that the show was wildly successful, though, and fortunately for fans, Alex Hirsch has said he's open to renewing the series for a few more episodes or even some one-off specials. And odds are, Linda and the rest of the cast would be happy to jump back into Gravity Falls for a reboot.</p><h2 id=who-was-linda-cardellini-before-39-gravity-falls-39>Who Was Linda Cardellini Before 'Gravity Falls'?</h2><p>For anyone who doesn't recognize Cardellini's name, she was a "thing" long before joining up with Disney to voice a teenager. But her career has been as long and surprising as 'Gravity Falls' was. Her first dive into film was in 1997's 'Good Burger,' though she also had a few minor gigs on various '90s-era series, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>James Gunn Says This Is The Reason Why Velma Wasn't Gay In The Scooby-Doo Movies</a></span></p><p>But after that, Linda also appeared on 'Boy Meets World' and 'Freaks and Geeks,' <a href=#>portrayed Velma in various iterations of 'Scooby-Doo,'</a> played a part in 'Brokeback Mountain,' and more.</p><p>A lot more, in fact; Linda Cardellini is perhaps most well-known for her 126-episode run on 'ER,' which lasted from 2003 to 2009. After that, she continued with more work on 'Scooby-Doo' projects and appeared on various other shows for varying lengths of time.</p><h2 id=what-is-linda-cardellini-doing-now>What Is Linda Cardellini Doing Now?</h2><p>Though multiple roles of Linda's also overlapped with 'Gravity Falls,' the animated series likely took up a lot of her time. After all, the show spanned over 30 episodes and four years. But Linda didn't have to sit around waiting on additional gigs after the series ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, her time on 'Gravity Falls' overlapped with other gigs on 'Sanjay and Craig' (she voiced Megan Sparkles and other characters), 'Regular Show,' and even 'Mad Men.'</p><p>After those gigs ended, though, where did Linda wind up?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Was January Jones Before 'Mad Men'?</a></span></p><p>It turns out she dove into another long-running series, 'Bloodline,' which ended in 2017. After that, she joined up on 'Dead to Me,' which has run since 2019. She collabs with Christina Applegate, which <a href=#>fueled speculation over whether the pair were really friends</a> or if they were just working together out of necessity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The thing is, it doesn't seem like Linda Cardellini has to take any gig out of 'necessity.' In fact, it seems like she purposely chooses projects that are fun and allow her to flex her creative muscles. She clearly has a lot of them, with the wide range of characters she's portrayed over the years.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Linda Cardellini: What People Forget About The Dead To Me Star</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmrp6mlK56p77OpmSgqpGrtrXFjJ%2BYpaSjYsCwwc2dnJ1lo6R6p63MoqOimaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-everything-we-know-about-kylie-jenners-secret-california-mega-mansion.html><span>←</span><span>Here's Everything We Know About Kylie Jenner's Secret California Mega Mansion</span></a>
