She also guest starred on Hannah Montana and Sonny With A Chance. Zendaya, Miley, and Selena also kicked off their music careers while still on Disney.

Continue reading to see which of your favorite celebrities made a cameo on a Disney Channel show.</p><h2 id=chris-bosh><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Chris Bosh</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Former NBA player Chris Bosh starred on Jessie's "Say Yes to the Messy Dress" episode back in 2013. He starred alongside the show's main cast, including Debby Ryan, Peyton List, Skai Jackson, Karan Brar, and the late Cameron Boyce. Chris joined a long list of fellow NBA players who have also made cameos on Disney Channel shows. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwight Howard</a>, Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, and other former and current NBA athletes have also made cameos on some of Disney's hit shows.</p><h2 id=iyaz><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Iyaz</span></h2><p>British Virgin Islands singer Iyaz got the chance to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guest star on an episode of Hannah Montana </a>back in 2010. On the episode, he and Hannah record a duet called "Gonna Get This" as Hannah is recovering from a case of writer's block. Iyaz, who is allegedly a fan of Hannah Montana, spoke highly of his experience working on the Hannah Montana set. He said, "it was a lot of fun, and definitely a lifetime experience."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-archuleta><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>David Archuleta</span></h2><p>Iyaz is not the only singer who got to record a duet with Miley Cyrus for an episode of Hannah Montana. American Idol's Season 7 runner-up David Archuleta <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guest starred on Hannah Montana's "Promma Mia" episode</a> in Season 3. On the episode, Hannah and David sing a sweet duet called "I Wanna Know You."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Here's How Young Selena Gomez Was When She Starred In Wizards of Waverly Place">Here's How Young Selena Gomez Was When She Starred In Wizards of Waverly Place</a></span></p><h2 id=shakira><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Shakira</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shakira guest starred on an episode of the third season of Wizards of Waverly Place. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">episode was titled "Dude Looks Like Shakira." </a>On this hilarious episode, Shakira played herself - kind of. The Russos' Uncle Kelbo had been using magic to turn himself into Shakira, so Shakira got to appear whenever Uncle Kelbo turned into her. During one of the transformations, Shakira got to perform her song "Gypsy" alongside one of the show's stars, Selena Gomez.</p><h2 id=shaquille-o-39-neal><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Shaquille O'Neal</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Former NBA player Shaquille O'Neal hilariously <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guest starred on an episode of Sonny With A Chance</a> back in 2010.

Allstar Weekend also guest starred on this episode.</p><h2 id=dwayne-quot-the-rock-quot-johnson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</span></h2><p>The Rock has made cameos on not one but two Disney Channel shows. Like many of the other stars on this list, he guest starred on Hannah Montana for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Don't Stop Til You Get the Phone" episode</a> in 2007. He also made a cameo on the "Never the Dwayne Shall Meet" episode of Cory in the House in the same year.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Miley Cyrus Almost Lost Hannah Montana To These Stars...

Billy Ray Cyrus appointed Dolly to be Miley Cyrus's godmother after they connected as country music artists. Dolly went on to <a href=#>star as Miley's on-screen "Aunt Dolly"</a> on Hannah Montana. She appeared on a few episodes to give Hannah some much-needed advice.</p><h2 id=tyra-banks><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tyra Banks</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tyra Banks <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guest starred on an episode of Shake It Up! in 2012</a>.

The episode is called "Parent Trap It Up," and it follows Rocky (Zendaya) and CeCe (Bella Thorne) as they get advice from Ms. Burke to plan CeCe's dad's proposal to her mom. Shake It Up! was not Tyra's first Disney Channel cameo as she also guest starred in Hannah Montana: The Movie in 2009.</p><h2 id=carly-rae-jepsen><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Carly Rae Jepsen</span></h2><p>Shake It Up!'s "My Fair Librarian It Up!" episode was full of guest stars. Canadian pop singer Carly Rae Jepsen guest starred on the same episode of Shake It Up! as Tyra Banks. Unlike Tyra, the "Call Me Maybe" singer starred as herself, and she even got to perform her song "Sweetie" on the on-screen dance show Shake It Up Chicago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cindy-crawford><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Cindy Crawford</span></h2><p>Tyra Banks was not the only supermodel to make a cameo on a Disney Channel show.
