"I can't promise anything, or jump over the moon. But I think it takes time for all wounds… I take full responsibility for my actions and things that I’ve done in the past. I think it’s just a time thing."</p><p>More recently, in January 2020, he hinted to fans that his love for his ex hasn’t left even after all these years they have been apart.</p><p>“When someone asks, after all this time… why are u still in love WITH HER?” He captioned of his Instagram photos. “My ANSWER: BECAUSE TIME HAS NO RELEVANCE WHEN ITS UNCONDITIONAL,”</p><p>While he could’ve been talking about any of his ex-girlfriends, including Rihanna, it hasn’t gone unnoticed that Brown has gone above and beyond in keeping up with Tran’s life, having even commented on several of her IG photos in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He’s also mentioned her in a number of his songs, including the Back to Sleep remix featuring Zayn Malik and Usher, all of which have been failed attempts to convince her in giving him another chance.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Brown And Daughter ‘Royalty’ Celebrate Her First Million Followers … At Age 6</a></span></p><p>As mentioned above, however, the 32-year-old did not like the fact that she was still running through Brown’s mind, particularly because there had also been an occasion where he allegedly showed up to her home unannounced.</p><p>The incident would <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">result in the filing for a restraining order</a>, which was granted by a judge, who ordered the pop superstar to keep his distance from his ex for five years.</p><p>Tran revealed a series of text messages in court that were said to have been sent by Brown shortly after their breakup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One particular message read: "I'm not being nice to you no more, if I see you out in public again and I'm there I will make you hate me even more, don't be anywhere I'm out in public, I'm going to ban you from all events.”</p><p>She also accused him of threatening violence on her family before ending one of his messages by telling his former flame he will “make your life hell.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Brown Teaches His Daughter #MissRoyaltyBrown How To Get Her Boxing Groove On</a></span></p><p>By the end of 2017, Tran started dating former football player Victor Cruz, who she has been happily in love with since their first get-together.</p><p>The couple’s pairing certainly didn’t sit well with Brown, who once again took to his Instagram platform to express how he felt about the whole situation.</p><p>In June 2019, Cruz had posted a photo of himself with his girlfriend, and Brown had taken it upon himself to share his thoughts about his ex’s new man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Nothing bad or major. UPGRADE HIM SIS. I’ll take him around to style him. NOT HATE. He just need some game spirit,” he wrote.</p><p>He continued: “Peace love and joy. JUST PLEASE UPGRADE YA MAN BOO […] He look like he shopping of the manikin[sic] and trying to bargain wit the sales manager. Retired wrestler pants. I’M F****** AROUND… good bless.” He then added, “No shade...just minor.”</p><p>Despite all of the attempts Brown has mad to get his ex-girlfriend’s attention, she has shown little to no interest in even offering him a response, showing clear signs that Tran does not see herself getting back with her ex.</p><p>Also, considering that she’s been with Cruz for almost three years, their relationship has lasted longer than the romance she shared with Brown considering how the former couple was constantly breaking up and getting back together.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things Rihanna’s Been Doing Instead Of Dropping A New Album</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWTnb%2Bqv4ybqaivnmLAtbXLpWSipl2hvLexjLCgraBdnba0ecSxZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmo5Gnv7axwqGcZqyilrtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./iggy-azalea-lists-her-lavish-los-angeles-home-for-6-2-million.html><span>←</span><span>Iggy Azalea Lists Her Lavish Los Angeles Home For $6.2 Million</span></a>
