You need to work the room. These people need to see how good you look.’”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Palmer praised Hudson for “breathing so much life into me” when she needed it most. “I feel like he brought me back to the world, honey. He really did.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>After welcoming Leodis — who she shares with fitness instructor <a href=#><strong>Darius Jackson</strong></a> — Palmer returned to the scene as both a mom and a refined fashionista. She graced several red carpets in figure-hugging ensembles by Hudson that showed off her post-baby body.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Her most notable Hudson creations came <a href=#>at the Met Gala</a> in May and the Fragrance Foundation Awards in June. For fashion’s biggest night, Palmer channeled Old Hollywood in a strapless sparkly gown that nailed the evening’s <a href=#>Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty</a> as it paid homage to the late designer’s ‘90s reign at Chanel. The following month, she looked as glamorous as ever in a skintight black velvet dress that was equipped with a plunging neckline and spaghetti straps.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Keke-Palmer-Talks-Designer-Sergio-Hudsons-Impact-on-Her-Life-2.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s2>Palmer also turned heads — and made headlines </span><span class=s1>— when she wore a sheer frock by Givenchy at one of <a href=#><strong>Usher</strong></a>’s Las Vegas residency shows in July. The piece became a trending topic when Jackson, 29, threw shade at the revealing ensemble. “It’s the outfit tho … you a mom,” Jackson wrote via Twitter alongside a video of Palmer on stage being serenaded by Usher, 44. Earlier this month, Palmer <a href=#>appeared to poke fun at Jackson’s comments</a> when she starred in Usher’s “Boyfriend” music video, which showed her dancing with the musician at a casino.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Hudson, for his part, is equally grateful for Palmer, telling Essence that the actress is his “muse.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Until now, the only muse I ever had a relationship with was my mom,” he told the magazine. “But when Keke and I first met, immediately there was a clip. We were right there. She said she had this immediate trust in me, and all I really wanted was to make her look as beautiful as she is.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>He added, “She inspires me. Her talent is limitless. … She pours into me, and then I pour into her and onto her. I see a vision of who she is and where she should be, style-wise.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6CyrLGMqZilpZWnerSt2KxknZ2jnrSvsdFmqp6ql568brTUnaqopl2XvLC%2F056bZqCVp3qku82foJ2dnpiycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-beckinsale-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-391286-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Beckinsale Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
