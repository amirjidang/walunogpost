Any role he is given, even if the movie doesn't have praising reviews, he has managed to excel with his charismatic approach. In his first marriage with the late Samantha Lewes, he has two children, with Colin taking on acting after his father. When he married his current wife Rita Wilson, they welcomed two sons into the world, including his son <a href=#>Chester "Chet" Marlon Hanks</a>. Chet also took on acting, but has been focusing as a musician, releasing his viral video<a href=#> "White Boy Summer"</a> in 2021 as a play on Megan Thee Stallion's "Hot Girl Summer."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chet has become somewhat of the black sheep in his family, due to the controversies he was associated with, whereas his father has the phrase "America's dad" given his clean and nice persona. While it is good for Chet to make a name for himself, it certainly hasn't really been an entirely positive experience. With Chet being financially cut off from his parents, how has this affected him?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is Tom Hanks And His Son Chet Hanks' Relationship Like Now?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-chet-feels-about-his-parents>How Chet Feels About His Parents</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the questions Chet got a lot from his followers is simply, "What's it like to be Tom Hanks' son?" This question stuck out to him ever since he was 14 and went to the White House while George W. Bush was president. The 43rd president asked the young Chet, "“Hey Chester, what’s it like growing up the son of a famous father?” The 14-year-old at the time, caught off guard, replied, "Well Mr. President, there’s a lot of advantages, but sometimes it can be pretty weird." In response, Bush chuckled back with "That's a good answer. I think I know a little something about that." This gave Chet and Bush a common feeling of being famous for what their father was recognized for.</p><p>Chet goes on to say that for the opportunities he had, he was blessed for having them and also loved his parents. According to Chet, fame is the most powerful drug to humanity and the most destructive. For recognition he would get just for being the son of Tom Hanks, it gave contempt and make people assume that he's spoiled rotten, but he claims that he's privileged, not spoiled. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">If he were to want money, he wasn't just simply given it</a>, but instead his father told him to do simple chores and he'll pay him for it, earning the money in the process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tom Hanks' Son Finally Reveals “Toxic Fame” While Growing Up</a></span></p><h2 id=aftermath-of-tom-cutting-off-chet-financially>Aftermath Of Tom Cutting Off Chet Financially</h2><p>As of 2022, reported by Idol Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chet Hanks has an estimated net worth of around three million dollars.</a> For someone who is on his own, despite having the last name of a famous actor, it's not entirely the worst outcome for someone like him. He seems to be doing well even going through a lot of hardships, including his struggles with substance abuse and <a href=#>his complicated history with his ex-girlfriend Kiana Parker</a>, who is the mother of his daughter Micaiah.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if Chet isn't under his parents' name in finance, he's made it clear that he loves his parents and he's grateful to grow up as someone who could have had everything he wanted with the fame and fortune, but he has learned to be humble with what he's given and achieve things on his own.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Soulja Boy Fans Question Why He Signed Tom Hanks' Son To His Record Label</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-chet-up-to-now>What Is Chet Up To Now?</h2><p>Today, Chet has been content in what he is currently doing. While he has endured of what other people have said behind his back or take advantage of him due to being the son of Tom, the 31-year-old overcame the anger and the insecurity he felt when growing up as a privileged, but mostly normal kid growing up. By creating his YouTube channel, Chet is using it to be open and honest about himself and giving himself a spotlight that has nothing to do with how he got to where he is. Instead, he prioritizes in doing his best to be a better version of himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chet's personal life seems stable, as he has a girlfriend named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa Mays</a>, who is also an artist. They have posted loving tributes on Valentine's Day, cementing their dedication and love for one another. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His website Hanxfit</a> is where he hosts his fitness program and is one of the ways he gets his income. Even with some questionable statements he made in the past and the controversies he was in, Chet is more than just a son of a famous actor. With his willingness to improve physically and emotionally, he is putting himself on a stable path that has been beneficial for him so far.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Tom Hanks Son Chet Trolled For Anti-Vaxxer Rant Despite Parents Contracting Virus</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq%2FHnqtmoJGjuLR5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpecCfq56qXam8rnnFmqOlp6WpfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-carrot-top-2022.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Carrot Top?</span></a>
