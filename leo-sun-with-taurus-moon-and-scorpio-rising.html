Normally, you are self-controlled, calm, and sympathetic: in short, a stronghold of common sense and worldly wisdom. But when you are in a stressful or tense situation or when things just aren’t going your way, you are just the opposite: temperamental, moody, unreasonable—even tyrannical.</p><p>A heaviness pervades the Leo Sun Taurus Moon individual. Intense, dramatic, and purposeful, there are only a few things you desire in life, but they can become all-consuming. Sensual and materialistic, you pursue power and status primarily for the comfort and luxury they provide. Like most Leos, you are a bit of an egomaniac. With self-assurance and near total faith in your strengths and intuition, you strive hard to fulfill your dreams and ambitions. And you are very ambitious!</p><p>Since both signs of the Leo Sun Taurus Moon combination are fixed signs, you have the dogged determination to achieve the heights you feel you deserve. Yet, despite those admirable qualities, you can be your own worst enemy. Overconfidence and rigidity often blind your judgment and cause you to unconsciously undermine your own efforts.</p><p>Having a Leo Sun Taurus Moon, you are pragmatic and have a broad and far-reaching vision, but the absolute faith you have in yourself often causes you to reject or ignore the opinions of others. How many times have you stubbornly neglected what others have said, only to discover your mistake later on?</p><p>With a Leo Sun Taurus Moon, you are capable of tremendous creativity, but only after you have learned to cooperate with people. Since you cannot be right all the time, open your mind to a bit of advice. Loosen up in your convictions and learn to respect and tolerate other points of view. You may be a born leader, but the best leaders know enough to compromise now and then.</p><p>If you’re an individual with a Leo Sun Taurus Moon, it’s not easy for you to accept defeat. Not getting your way throws you into states of depression, and you become liable to temperamental fits—often taking out your anger on those around you. This is due to that strong ego and extraordinary pride. Nobody, unless they are very lucky, can be continuously successful. We all must learn to cope with disappointments now and then. Detach yourself a little more from your activities.</p><p>For the individual with a Leo Sun Taurus Moon, ultimately, happiness and inner peace can come only from within. Next time you feel thwarted or frustrated, don’t take it so hard. Instead, look at it from a distance, and learn from the experience rather brooding over it. Try channeling excess tension and energy into some creative activities. Instead of taking things out on the kids or your co-workers, try athletics, meditation, or even art. You need plenty of diversion to keep from becoming obsessed with one goal or aim.</p><p>As a Leo Sun Taurus Moon individual, you are sensual and earthy, a good sex life is vital to maintaining your overall happiness and well-being. You are not particularly romantic and you have a cavalier approach to love. Many affairs are likely for a Leo Sun Taurus Moon individual. Watch for jealousy and over-possessiveness, and be certain to respect your partner’s freedom and desires.</p><h3>Keywords For A Leo Sun Taurus Moon:</h3><p>Love of grandeur; generous; magnetic; stubborn; traditional; sensual;&nbsp;dictatorial; egocentric; administrator; regal; seeks a powerful position; pragmatic;&nbsp;dependable; capable; productive; materialistic; artistic flair; the showman; loyal;&nbsp; self-seeking.&nbsp;</p><h2>Scorpio Rising</h2><p>If you were born with Scorpio Rising, you put the whole force of your personality behind everything you do. You are not a halfway person. Scorpio Rising individuals have an intensity, a dynamism that seethes and roils under the surface. Your willpower and determination are formidable.</p><p>Having Scorpio Rising, though you are sometimes viewed as a lone wolf, you do have an ability to work with people—actually, to lead people. You are strongly persuasive and vigorously pursue your goals, and in addition have the power to make others pursue the same goals.</p><p>Clever, creative, and resourceful, with Scorpio Rising, your fertile mind seems to be an inexhaustible source of ideas and suggestions. Your brain behind your cool facade is always ticking away. One of the things you must do is find out how something works, to dissect it, study it, and put it back together so that it works better. This is also true in artistic terms; you can do great visionary work if you have Scorpio Rising in your chart.</p><p>As a Scorpio Rising individual you are happiest when you can control from behind the scenes. You tend to be secretive and reserved, and shun the spotlight because you can’t work there unnoticed. If you are domineering, it is a subtle dominance, a kind of mind control.</p><p>Some people claim that they are hypnotized by Scorpio Rising individuals; it’s true that you have a way of knowing what others are thinking. Much of this comes from your acute powers of observation. You are a charming, witty conversationalist, but the acute observer will soon notice that it is the other person who is doing most of the talking.</p><p>With Scorpio Rising, you are usually quietly watching, waiting, observing— filing away information that will be useful later on. Scorpio Rising individuals have a reputation for a sharp temper; the reputation is deserved. When crossed, you can be cruel and biting. You tend to use any weapon at your disposal—from ridicule to playing on a person’s fears. In the heat of that moment, the Scorpio Rising must be the victor. Later, you are remorseful for having dealt wounds, though it is extremely hard for you to say so.</p><p>Scorpio is the astrological sign of hidden passion; Scorpio Rising individuals tend to have a secret love affair at least one time in their lives, and usually marry more than once. They may suffer more financial setbacks and disappointments than other rising signs; but no other sign is more victorious in the end.</p><p>As a Scorpio Rising individual you tend to have sharp features, a prominent nose, and large, hypnotic eyes. Sometimes your brows are thick and dark. Your body is agile and moves decisively.</p><p>The planet Pluto, which rules Scorpio, is very prominent in your birth chart. The influence of Pluto bestows powerful feelings and emotions, a sense of purpose, persistence, determination, plus the imagination and ability to make a successful start in a new direction. This planet’s influence also favors secrecy, suspicion, jealousy, and cruelty.</p><p>Uncover deeper insights into your personality, motivations, & desires with an <a href=#><span><strong>In-Depth Astrology & Numerology Natal Chart Analysis</strong></span></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tb7UpbCdoaaeu6Z6wqikaKulo3quu86nZqWdn2LAtrqMsKCtoF2prra%2B1Kxkpqefo3qiusNmqpynoqW2sHnRoqqippc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kiersey-clemons-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-243375-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kiersey Clemons Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
