In the winter, we often reach for a deep berry or wine shade, while in summer we love to pull out an apricot. When it comes to everyday wear all year long, however, a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">perfect peachy-pink</a> is all we need. Something that makes us look like we’re glowing from inside!</p><p>One popular choice among celebrities is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NARS’s famous Orgasm blush</a>, but the price is a little out there, especially for something we’re going to be using every day and repurchasing again and again. That’s why we loved when <strong>Kyle Richards</strong> revealed the contents of her beauty bag earlier this year. She introduced Us to a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">more affordable pick</a> that’s just as fabulous!</p><p><strong>Get <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">theBalm Hot Mama!

It’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hot Mama! made by theBalm</a> and it’s amazing.” She noted that it has the “perfect amount of highlight” so that she really doesn’t need much else. This product can be used in numerous ways!</p><p>You can use a brush to swirl the powder onto the apples of your cheeks, or you can glide it along your cheekbones to illuminate your bone structure. You can also use it as an eyeshadow, or all of the above at the same time!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/thebalm-hot-mama-blush-kyle-richards.jpg><p><strong>Get <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">theBalm Hot Mama!

It gives you that luminous, natural glow. Richards is proof, of course, as she’s always glowing and radiant!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This travel-size blush</a> is great because you can use it both at home or on the go, sticking it in your own beauty bag or everyday <a href=# data-link=1>purse</a> or even small clutch or wristlet. It has a little mirror in it too, so you don’t have to worry if you can’t get to a bigger one. Of course, you can always grab one for home and one for your bag too.
