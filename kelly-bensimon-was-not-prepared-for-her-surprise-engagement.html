So I was like, ‘You know, that’s a really great spot to do it with good people and just like good vibes,’” she explains. “Not like being a wedding photo or an engagement photo but a memory of all of my friends. That’s really the core of who I am. It’s just really making these strong connections and continuing them on.”</p><p>When it comes to the actual wedding, Bensimon — who starred on The Real Housewives of New York from seasons 2 through 4 — says the couple are in the midst of trying to “figure out” the details.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kelly-Killoren-Bensimon-photos-271.jpg><p>“Scott wants to get married right away. My youngest daughter’s like ‘Mom, it takes six months to have a dress made.’ I’m like, ‘What do we do?,’” she tells Us. “It’s just fun that [the kids] are very interested.”</p><p>The Bravo personality shares daughters Sea, 25, and Teddy, 23, with ex-husband <strong>Gilles Bensimon</strong>. The twosome were married from 1997 to 2007.</p><p>The details around their nuptials may not be set in stone but Bensimon and Litner do have one decision set in stone: two separate ceremonies.</p><p>“I think we’re going to do a very small wedding with just my family and his family. And then we’re going to do a big party with all of our friends. … I wanted to do something that was kind of different,” she says.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Aside from their engagement and wedding planning, Bensimon and Litner are taking another big step together — moving in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kelly-Killoren-Bensimon-photos-270.jpg><p>“We’re looking for an apartment today,” Bensimon tells Us, adding that Litner also has three sons from a previous relationship as well. “I mean we’ve got all these kids of different ages so it’s going to be fun. I was thinking because my oldest daughter is 25 so by the time she starts having kids, we’re going to have grandkids. It’s just going to be like nonstop.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZyhxm6uxKeqoqWfo3q4rdJmpaisXaW%2FprzAq5ydZZakv260xKtkrK2ipb%2Bqv8RmnKefkZyyrrHNrWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kanye-west-2016-mental-breakdown-1234806957.html><span>←</span><span>Kanye West's Ex-Trainer Details Bizarre 2016 Mental Breakdown</span></a>
