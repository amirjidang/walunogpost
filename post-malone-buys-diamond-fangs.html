The rapper recently splurged on a new pair of diamond fangs that came with an impressive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">price tag</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The musician’s dentist, Dr. Thomas Connelly, confirmed the news on his public Instagram page, which features over 212,000 followers. Dr. Connelly, who has clinics in both L.A. and New York, shared a black-and-white image of Post Malone with his new teeth. In the caption, the celebrity dentist revealed that the singer spent $1.6 million on the fangs, which feature 12-carats of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">diamonds</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Post Malone Net Worth (& 10 Things He Spends His Money On)</a></span></p><p>“With a smile that shows off natural Porcelain Veneer work frames with 2 Diamond Fans with a total weight of 12 Carats,” Dr. Connelly wrote. “Post Malone literally has a $1 million smile!!!”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Sugar</a>, Dr. Connelly has worked with plenty of celebrities in the past, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travis Barker</a> and DaBaby. He specializes in cosmetic dentistry work. To achieve Post’s glitzy fangs, the dentist reportedly had to use 40 carats of diamonds, which were originally imported from Belgium before being cut into shape in Israel to fit the singer’s smile. The rapper reportedly requested the cosmetic enhancements after seeing other famous faces with diamonds in their teeth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It wasn’t an easy process, however, as reports say it took Dr. Connelly and his team over a year and a half to create the finished product. It specifically took several months to get the fit correct in order to place the fangs in Post’s mouth. Dr. Connelly worked with a variety of experts on the project, including Dr. Naoki Hayashi, a cosmetic dentist, and Angel City Jewelers’ Isaac Bokhoor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dr. Connelly made two more posts focused on Post Malone’s expensive smile. In one of the posts, he uploaded a video featuring a mold of Post’s teeth complete with the infamous diamond fangs. In another, he shared a screenshot from an article published by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a> in which he discusses Post’s new smile. In the interview, Dr. Connelly explained he originally met Post Malone several years ago at Madison Square Garden when the rapper was looking to get a diamond tooth (or two) installed. Despite never having attempted such a feat, Dr. Connelly agreed to take on the project.</p><p>The dentist added that thanks to the success of Post’s procedure, many other famous faces are lining up to have the cosmetic enhancement done, including Odell Beckham Jr. Dr. Connelly currently has a waiting list.</p><p>As of now, Post Malone has not directly commented on his headline-making smile nor has he posted any photos to his social media featuring the fangs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Post Malone's Purest Tweets That Make Us Love Him Even More</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Sugar</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS9sL%2FTZqSapJ%2Bjsm6u1LKqZpyZlrqwusNmnZqml6h8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-harvey-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Paul Harvey Net Worth - Wealthy Genius</span></a>
