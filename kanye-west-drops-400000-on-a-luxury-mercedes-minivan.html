Whittington. The company specializes in creating custom transportation, often for celebrity clients.</p><p>Kanye is no stranger to luxury cars, as he has <a href=#>quite the collection to his name</a> already. He’s been seen driving a number of Lamborghinis, including a Gallardo, Aventador, and Urus. In addition, the musician owns a Bugatti Veyron, Aston Martin DBS, Porsche Panamera Turbo, and a Porsche 991 Carrera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His new minivan isn’t his only Mercedes Benz, as he also has an SLR McLaren and a SLR McLaren Stirling Moss, which sells for at least $1 million.</p><p>While Kanye’s decision to invest in a luxury minivan may seem out-of-character given his love for small supercars, it could be part of his effort to focus more on his children.</p><p>Since Kim Kardashian filed for divorce in February 2021, the rapper has been vocal about his children being his priority. <a href=#>Kanye made headlines earlier this year</a> when he bought a house across from the mansion he used to share with Kim in order to be closer to their four kids -- North, 8, Saint, 6, Chicago, 4, and Psalm, 2.</p><p>The Hidden Hills property cost the rapper $4.5 million, though he reportedly paid $400,000 over the asking price. Sources said he bought the home primarily for its location and has plans to tear down the existing home in order to renovate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The existing structure is over 3,600 square feet and features a two-car garage, outdoor pool, and three-stall barn.</p><p>Kanye references the purchase on his new song ‘Eazy,’ where he raps, “What you think the point of really bein' rich for?”</p><p>In the same song, Kanye goes on to criticize Kim’s parenting, accusing her of relying on nannies and camera crews to watch their children. He also references Kim’s new boyfriend, Saturday Night Live’s Pete Davidson, saying that he survived his 2002 car crash “just so I can beat Pete Davidson’s ass.”</p><p>Kim and Kanye’s divorce is ongoing, though both have requested joint custody of their children. Kim also filed paperwork to be declared legally single last December, as they continue to divide their financial assets.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kenny Chesney Sells Nashville Mansion For $11.5 Million</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Wires Only</a>, <a href=#>Motorious</a>, <a href=#>Hollywood Life</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4orrYnmSwnaOpeqW%2BzqmqZmxgZX1xfIyopWaZXaHCucHRsmSmnaKYsqWx0makoqaZq66vew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julie-martin.html><span>←</span><span>Julie Martin</span></a>
