Over the last few years, Pettyfer has been much less active - and seems to have almost fallen off the radar. You may have seen him most recently appearing as Brody in the Netflix series The I-Land. He is currently filming for science-fiction thriller Warning, which he will star in, and the movie will be out in cinemas next year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Has The Success Of 'Squid Games' Made The Cast Millionaires?</a></span></p><p>Pettyfer's career started promisingly, and he has been getting steady work since his acting debut as a teen, so with all this success, just how much is the actor worth? Read on to find out.</p><h2 id=when-did-pettyfer-start-acting><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>When Did Pettyfer Start Acting?</span></h2><p>Alex has been acting since a very young age. At 15, he left his school to change to the prestigious Sylvia Young Theatre School, London, which includes the likes of Adele and Amy Winehouse amongst its famous showbiz alumni.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He did very well at the school - so well that he was soon 'discovered', and appeared in a TV series called Tom Brown's Schooldays. Very soon after this, he took a huge step up and was cast as the lead in Stormbreaker - playing an MI6 schoolboy called Alex Rider. His performance received generally favourable reviews, and cemented his position as a teen star.</p><h2 id=he-39-s-also-worked-as-a-director><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He's Also Worked As A Director</span></h2><p>Alex's talents aren't just limited to his acting. Oh no. He's also worked as a director, having made his debut with movie Back Roads.</p><p>“It was such an amazing life-changing experience for me, creatively," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said in an interview with NME</a>, "Previously, as an actor, I was really focused on my own character’s arc and journey, and when you’re directing a movie this collaborative experience starts to transpire. You start to realise that the filmmaking experience is about collaboration and that’s key, so my whole psyche towards making films, and moving forward as an actor, has completely changed.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alex-has-a-complex-relationship-with-acting><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Alex Has A Complex Relationship With Acting</span></h2><p>Despite his success, Pettyfer has gained a reputation as difficult to work with. https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/26/alex-pettyfer-british-actor-journalists-debut-back-roads<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/26/alex-pettyfer-british-actor-journalists-debut-back-roads</a>. The actor himself feels he is still a work in progress. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with The Guardian</a>, the Wild Child actor described his transformation: “As humans, we can only evolve. I think that the times that I had that were difficult as a young man, I grew from those experiences. The only thing you can ever do from any experience, positive or negative, is to grow from it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He has also expressed his disappointment with the film industry, becoming confused about “what the business side of our industry is expecting”. His appreciation of the work that goes into filmmaking has matured, however: “If I had the experience that I had today back then, I probably would have done things differently. But the reason that I’m the man I am today is because of the experiences I endured [when working as an actor] as a young boy.”</p><h2 id=he-and-channing-tatum-reportedly-don-39-t-get-along><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He And Channing Tatum Reportedly Don't Get Along</span></h2><p>Pettyfer reportedly has a difficult relationship with fellow actor Channing Tatum, who he worked with on Magic Mike. It seems that things are definitely frosty between the pair, but Alex denies being the cause of the problem, and says he was just keeping it professional.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Let me put it this way,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor said in an interview</a> “There’s reports that me and Channing don’t get along, or that I don’t like Channing. That is not true.”</p><p>“My point is that I had the utmost respect for those two men that put [Magic Mike] together”, he says, calling the movie “a life-changing piece for me. What I said is that I presume that the man [Tatum] didn’t like me, but I don’t know. When you make a movie, you don’t come off the movie being best friends … you’re going into business with someone.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Zoe Kravitz And Channing Tatum Celebrate Halloween With Cult Movie ‘Taxi Driver’ Costumes</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-his-romantic-life-like><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>What Is His Romantic Life Like?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alex's love life has had its fair share of ups and downs.</p><p>When he was twenty, he dated Glee star <strong>Diana Agron</strong> - a relationship which ultimately took a very dark turn. Things moved quickly for the couple after they met in 2010 - they soon moved in together, and Pettyfer was reportedly obsessed by his new love. By February 2011, however, things were over between them, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports emerged that Alex had been controlling, verbally abusive, and paranoid about his girlfriend</a>. Agron distanced herself from Pettyfer - who was told to keep his distance from the actress.</p><p>Pettyfer also dated actress and grand-daughter of music legend Elvis Presley, Riley Keough. They were briefly engaged before this relationship also went sour.</p><p>In 2019, however, Alex found love with German model <strong>Antonia 'Toni' Garnn</strong>. The two married after a whirlwind romance and welcomed a daughter this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=so-how-much-is-pettyfer-worth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>So How Much Is Pettyfer Worth?</span></h2><p>Having acted and modelled from a very young age, the thirty-one year-old has built up a considerable net worth. According to sources, the figure is estimated to be around $3.5 million. Looks, talent, and millions in the bank. Looks like Alex really hit the jackpot in life!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Happened To Alex Pettyfer's Acting Career?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYpZ2oYr2mwNOynZ6qXaOytXnWqKmtoF2pvKWt2Gg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./below-deck-what-happened-between-rachel-hargrove-and-eddie-lucas.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened Between Rachel Hargrove And Eddie Lucas?</span></a>
