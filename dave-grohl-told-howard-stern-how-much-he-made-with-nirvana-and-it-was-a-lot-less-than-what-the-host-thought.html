Since the band disbanded following Kurt Cobain’s death, Grohl has gone on to join popular bands such as the Foo Fighters and Them Crooked Vultures.

Despite this, they sold more than 75 million records across the world. Given that they are one of the best-selling bands of all time, most people assume that the members of Nirvana made millions. In reality, they weren’t as wealthy as most people believe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a 1993 interview with Melody Marker, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kurt Cobain revealed how much money he’d actually made with Nirvana</a>.</p><p>"I know it's to be expected that people think I am wealthy, they'll think, ‘You sold 10 million albums, so that's 10 million dollars.’ But it's not,” he explained. “I made a million dollars off that record [Nevermind]. Over 300,000 dollars went on taxes, there were legal problems and medical bills because we didn't get insurance in time. I found myself spending all that money, all at once, all in that one year. I also bought a house, too." Most of Cobain's fortune was amassed years after his death.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/dave-grohl-has-a-strict-rule-when-it-comes-to-singing-nirvana-songs.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Dave Grohl Has A Strict Rule When It Comes To Singing Nirvana Songs">Dave Grohl Has A Strict Rule When It Comes To Singing Nirvana Songs</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Dave Grohl has specific rules when it comes to singing Nirvana songs, especially following Kurt Cobain's passing.</p><p>In a more recent interview with Howard Stern, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dave Grohl revealed how much money he earned playing the drums for Nirvana</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“So when Nirvana ends, were you so wealthy at that point that you could have stopped everything?” Stern asked. “When I think of Nirvana, I think of Nirvana money for a second, it had to be insane.” The radio host noted that ticket sales from their tours must have made them a lot of money but Grohl answered that they didn’t tour much.</p><p>“But the records,” Stern continued. “You sold a lot of records. And I guess there was enough money there that you could have lived the rest of your life [with]?” He wasn’t wrong. Nirvana’s 1991 album Nevermind was certified Diamond by the RIAA, indicating sales of over 10 million copies in the United States alone. It was also certified multi-platinum in several other countries around the world, so the band clearly sold millions of records.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Yeah, I mean, at that point I was 24, 25 years old,” Grohl said of his wealth at the time. “I’d never made more than $3.25 an hour.” Stern then asked him what his net worth was at the time. “Alright, so somewhere around $15 million you were worth,” Stern concluded. While a $15 million net worth is impressive, it’s not as much money as most people think the members of Nirvana made.</p><h2 id=dave-grohl-doesn-rsquo-t-make-a-lot-of-money-from-nirvana-royalties>Dave Grohl Doesn’t Make a Lot of Money from Nirvana Royalties</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar48559657.jpg><p>Even today, thirty years after they disbanded, Nirvana is still one of the most popular rock bands of all time. The band’s songs continue to be played on the radio and their merch is still sold in thousands of stores.
