In fact, both of the stars have two children each, with Darcey having daughters and Stacey having sons, and they are all around the same age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the second season of the show, viewers are got an inside look into <a href=#>Darcey's rocky relationship with Georgi,</a> and things were unraveling fast. Despite the duo feeling the heat, all eyes were on Stacey and Florian as the two discussed growing their family.</p><p>In fact, fans thought at one point that <a href=#>Stacey and Florian were "relationship goals,"</a> despite the negative rumors about Florian's intentions.</p><p>Family seems to be quite a big issue when it comes to the duo, leaving fans a little confused as Stacey already has two sons, however, they're never on the show. Although Darcey Silva has her daughters on, viewers wonder why Stacey's boys are nowhere to be found.</p><p><strong>Updated on September 4, 2022: </strong>Despite being a reality TV star, it seems like Stacey Silva actually does appreciate some privacy. Her Instagram account, while verified and followed by thousands of people, is locked, meaning only followers she approves of can see her posts. And on the sisters' shared Instagram, only professional and promotional posts are shared; nothing personal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-are-stacey-silva-39-s-sons>Who Are Stacey Silva's Sons?</h2><p>Since the duo's time on 90 Day Fiancé, they have endured struggle after struggle when it comes to their choice of men, and nothing seems to have changed when it comes to Darcey's relationship with Georgi Rusev, and Stacey's marriage to Florian Sukaj.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Truth About '90 Day Fiance' Stars Darcey And Stacey's Rise To Fame">The Truth About '90 Day Fiance' Stars Darcey And Stacey's Rise To Fame</a></span></p><p>While Darcey and Georgi figure out their romance woes, Stacey and Florian were talking about starting a family. This conversation sparked interest in Stacey's two sons, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parker and Mateo, who she shares with her ex-husband</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-are-stacey-silva-39-s-two-sons>Who Are Stacey Silva's Two Sons?</h2><p>While Darcey's two daughters, Aniko and Aspen are present throughout the series, viewers wonder why Stacey's boys aren't. Stacey was previously married to Goran Vasic, a pro soccer player from Serbia.</p><p>Turns out, Stacey and Goran would rather have their sons live something of a private life, contrary to the life that Stacey Silva lives. The two are quite protective of their children's privacy.</p><p>However, in 2019, Stacey said that Mateo wanted to be a filmmaker, and was interested in writing.</p><p>Soap Dirt also suggested that Stacey's ex sometimes posts pictures of their sons on Facebook; that is difficult to confirm, but one rumored photo of the boys showed them as teens in 2020.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Who Is Darcey And Stacey's Dad And What Does He Do For A Living?">Who Is Darcey And Stacey's Dad And What Does He Do For A Living?</a></span></p><p>Stacey revealed in an episode that both of her boys are heading off to college, hence her desire to start a family with her hubby, Florian. While fans suspect that this might not be the best idea, considering she and Florian have lots of work to do, Stacey appears to be persistent in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her efforts at having more children.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans don't know too much about her kids, Stacey has shared a few pics of them on her social media, mainly birthday posts. Although they might not be on camera now, that might change when they are both 18 years old.</p><h2 id=will-stacey-silva-and-florian-sukaj-have-a-child-together>Will Stacey Silva And Florian Sukaj Have A Child Together?</h2><p>Stacey Silva has previously said that her biological clock is ticking fast; she turns 48 in 2022. But is Florian on board with having kids?</p><p>The Albanian native had a few choice words regarding his journey to fatherhood, revealing that when the time is right, it'll happen. "Now that we're in our new home, it's a good time to have a talk about having a baby!" Stacey said, which was followed by a seemingly nervous gulp from Florian.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Where Did TLC's Darcey And Stacey Get Their Money?">Where Did TLC's Darcey And Stacey Get Their Money?</a></span></p><p>"We've talked about having a bay, but never about timing! It's important 'cause I'd love to have a bay with Florian and I just truly feel like he deserves that same blessing," Stacey went on.</p><p>Florian Sukaj went on to say that he's content with him and Stacey being their own family, and if God wishes to bless them with a child, then so be it.</p><p>But in March 2022, Soap Dirt reported, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stacey had a checkup</a> that revealed she had few eggs remaining, leading the doctor to suggest their chances of conceiving naturally were likely around one percent.</p><p>At that time, however, Stacey noted that she and Florian were "always trying," so who knows what the future might bring for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqqTmsZurc2dZKyskZiyunnWoaZmmaKaerTAwJycsmWjnrm3rYyspqerXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christine-lahti-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Christine Lahti Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
