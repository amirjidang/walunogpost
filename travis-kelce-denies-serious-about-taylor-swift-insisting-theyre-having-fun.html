Swift attended her inaugural NFL game in September 2023, when they first hard launched their romance after beginning to date in the summer, and has since been a fervent supporter, attending over 10 Chiefs games. Travis, too, has made appearances at her ongoing Eras tour stops, though he was a no-show at the recent Grammys while prepping for the Super Bowl.</p><p>During Sunday's preshow interview, Travis shared about his connection with Swift, describing it as "an unexpected ride" that he has thoroughly enjoyed. Expressing his excitement for the impending Super Bowl, where he would later celebrate his third championship with the Chiefs (with a beaming Taylor in the crowd), Travis mentioned how even Coach Andy Reid has embraced Swift's presence among the team's cheering squad, indicating that everyone is having "some fun" with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-s-15-most-popular-songs-spotify-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift's 15 Most Popular Songs, Ranked (According To Spotify)">Taylor Swift's 15 Most Popular Songs, Ranked (According To Spotify)</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's top Spotify streams will likely be changing in accordance with the popularity of 'The Tortured Poets Department' songs.</p><p>Reflecting on the ups and downs of the 2023 season, Kelce characterized it as "a fun roller coaster" that he wholeheartedly embraces. He noted that the 2023 squad faced more challenges than in previous years, yet they persevered to make it to Super Bowl LVIII, where they successfully faced off against the San Francisco 49ers. With anticipation building for the big game, Kelce teased, "We’ll see where the cards end up," a statement that aged well, considering he did bring home the trophy to Taylor.</p><h2 id=taylor-watched-the-super-bowl-with-her-famous-friends-in-the-stands>Taylor Watched The Super Bowl With Her Famous Friends In The Stands</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-mtv-video-music-awards-2023-1.jpg><p>The Eras hitmaker was in the stand with several famous members of her squad, including Ice Spice, Keleigh Sperry, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Lively, who was reportedly adorned in nearly $500,000</a> worth of jewelry to accessorize her red and white tracksuit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For her part, Taylor kept her look simple with a black, monochromatic outfit, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports say she spent around $50,000 in total.</a> Taylor’s jewelry increased the price by a bit, but her pieces were clearly carefully chosen, as several were references to her NFL star boyfriend.</p><p>During the commotion, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cameras caught Lana Del Rey take a tumble</a> while sitting close to Swift. She appeared to lose her balance as the crowd got rowdy following a big play. Footage that’s now gone viral on social media shows Taylor not noticing her friend’s fall at first, though those around Lana quickly stepped in to help once her distress was noticed. The singers were able to shake off the brief incident, and Taylor was later photographed on the field after the Super Bowl congratulating Travis with several sweet moments and words of affection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5llJq7qrHSZqqeqpmkwrR5wJumrqxdqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbrXNrKCsrJmjtG7Ax56wq51dna63tc2gZJ%2BtnmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tou-thao-ethnicity-explored-as-former-minneapolis-police-officer-convicted-in-george-floyd-murder-626098-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tou Thao ethnicity explored as former Minneapolis police officer convicted in George Floyd murder</span></a>
