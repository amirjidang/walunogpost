Minaj brushed her blonde hair aside with her left hand — which boasted an impressive sparkler on her ring finger — multiple times.</p><p>On Thursday, July 25, DJ Khaled made headlines after he <a href=#>recorded a romantic message</a> to Minaj, in which he asked the outspoken rapper for her hand in marriage.</p><p>"I feel like you need a man like me in your life … we got the same symptoms, we're both suffering from success," he said in the video. "[If] you gotta take your time and think about it, I understand, but I know I have to be here today to let you know how serious I am and how serious this is to me."</p><p>Khaled finished off his speech with a heartfelt, "Nicki Minaj, will you marry me?" and a reported $500,000 10-carat ring in a box.</p><p>Though fans were initially confused about whether or not the proposal was genuine, Khaled exclusively assured <strong>Us</strong> that he is, indeed, serious. The pair have never been photographed together, and there have not been any previous reports of them dating.</p><p>"I want to marry her!" he told <strong>Us</strong>. "She can take her time and think about it. At least she knows how I feel now."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for rumors that Minaj has filed a restraining order on Khaled after news of his public proposal spread? Khaled slammed the reports in a tweet on Sunday, July 28.</p><p>"Y'all know better than that they don't put restraining orders on bosses I'm the DON U witnessing greatness I'm the best that ever did it! JUS KNOW!" he captioned <a href=#>an Instagram shot of himself </a>smoking a cigar. Khaled added the hashtag "suffering from success."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanoZOgtm65yKeYo2WjqbKxv4yorK1lp57BqXnGopinrF2ntq%2BzjJqdrZ2iYrGrecqhmKWdlGLDqrDEqGSpqp%2BlvLSty2anopukqr%2BmeZFpaGxqaWx8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-galvan-car-accident-did-mike-galvan-die.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Galvan Car Accident: Did Mike Galvan Die?</span></a>
