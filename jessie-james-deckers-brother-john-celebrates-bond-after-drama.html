Same humor, same crazy personality, even look pretty damn near the same,” he wrote alongside a laughing emoji. “So grateful to have you back in my life! It’s not to often that you just get somebody and they just get you and I really feel we have that bond.”</p><p>James added: “Cheers to 35 and all the amazing things you have in your future!”</p><p>The Texas resident also shared a throwback photo with his big sis from his childhood. “@jessiejamesdecker even used to come and have lunch with me at high school,” he captioned the snap, which featured both Jessie and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Eric Decker</strong></a>, in what appeared to be the lunchroom. “It was hilarious the whole cafeteria would get silent.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jessie-James-Deckers-Brother-John-James-Gushes-Over-Their-%E2%80%98Bond-in-Sweet-Birthday-Tribute-After-Family-Drama-067.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Kittenish founder</a>’s little brother and his wife, <strong>Ali James</strong> (née Green), sent Jessie a box of specialty cookies to celebrate her milestone birthday. “Happy birthday bitch! Love, the James family,” the card read, which Jessie shared via her Instagram Story along with a crying laughing emoji.</p><p>John’s message of love for his sister came nearly one year after <a href=#>he hinted at drama within their family unit</a>. The pair also <a href=#>have a sister named <strong>Sydney Rae Bass</strong> (née James)</a>, who was featured on Eric & Jessie in the past alongside their mom, <strong>Karen Parker</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jessie-James-Deckers-Brother-John-James-Gushes-Over-Their-%E2%80%98Bond-in-Sweet-Birthday-Tribute-After-Family-Drama-068.jpg><p>“I did not think there was a chance we would all be together in one room. Not a chance at all,” he said on a May 2022 episode of “The Spillover” podcast. “[My mom] wanted us to all be together for our birthday and I was really on the fence about going because I just didn’t want to go and then it be awkward — granted, you know, some of us haven’t talked in years.”</p><p>The group, however, did put aside their differences for their mother at the time and Jessie addressed the tension in June 2022. (The <a href=#>Just Feed Me author</a> previously raised eyebrows when she and her mother seemingly unfollowed her brother and his wife.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve had some family issues a couple years ago that I have struggled with tremendously and still to this day make me break down and cry,” <a href=#>the “Boys in the Summer” songstress wrote via Instagram</a> at the time. “I would’ve never chosen to deal with that publicly and open that door to such a personal family matter, but it happened, and it still hurts my heart.”</p><p>Jessie’s family appeared to continue to mend fences throughout summer 2022 when the Tennessee resident <a href=#>attended her brother’s wedding</a>. That November, <a href=#>all three siblings shared a series of goofy snaps</a> together on social media.</p><p>Earlier this year, the country singer revealed <a href=#>her “heart is full” after visiting her brother in February</a> and meeting his newborn son, Weston. “I’m so grateful for the time spent with my family,” James captioned an Instagram video from the fun reunion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnaOotqZ5yZqknqtdmbKkt8SrqmaaoqTBqbHRZqGooJ5isKa4xJupmqyVqHqju82dZJqepJq%2FbrDRmqSaZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jenny-apple-cancer.html><span>←</span><span>Jenny Apple Cancer: What Happened To Jenny Apple?</span></a>
