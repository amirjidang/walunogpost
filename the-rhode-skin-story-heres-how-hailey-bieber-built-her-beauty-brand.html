Her presence has graced the covers of prestigious magazines like Vogue, Elle, Harper's Bazaar, and many others. Hailey has also left her mark on the runways, showcasing the creations of <a href=#>top fashion brands such as Ralph Lauren</a>, Tommy Hilfiger, Saint Laurent, and Jimmy Choo. With a net worth of $20 million, she is one of the world's most influential celebrities. However, Hailey Bieber's accomplishments extend far beyond her captivating beauty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hailey Bieber has proven herself as a savvy entrepreneur, venturing into the skincare world with the launch of her skincare brand, Rhode, in June 2022. Rhode offers a thoughtfully curated collection of skincare essentials that nourish the skin barrier and leave it with a radiant, glazed finish.</p><h2 id=it-started-with-trademarks-rejections>It Started With Trademarks Rejections&nbsp;</h2><p>In the spring of 2019, Hailey Bieber embarked on a quest to trademark <a href=#>the name ‘Bieber Beauty</a>.’ Alas, her aspirations were swiftly dashed when her trademark application faced rejection due to its striking resemblance to a filing made by her husband, Justin Bieber, in 2010, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grazia</a>. However, Hailey ingeniously discovered a solution to breathe life into her envisioned brand. She decided to bestow upon it the name ‘Rhode,’ a nod to her middle name, thus triumphantly overcoming the trademark hurdle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Hailey Bieber's 10 Most Expensive Outfits" href=#>Hailey Bieber's 10 Most Expensive Outfits</a></span></p><p>Collaborating closely with a team of esteemed dermatologists and chemists, Hailey meticulously developed the formulas for her products. Her vision was to incorporate high-performance ingredients that were vegan, cruelty-free, gluten-free, and dermatologist-tested. She also aimed to exclude unnecessary additives that could harm the skin or the environment. Over two years, she dedicated herself to testing and refining her products until she achieved the desired results.</p><h2 id=the-dawn-of-rhode-skin>The Dawn Of Rhode Skin</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On June 8th, 2022, Rhode made its official debut, introducing three flagship products: the Peptide Glazing Fluid ($29), the Barrier Restore Cream ($29), and the Peptide Lip Treatment ($16) as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a>. The Peptide Glazing Fluid, a lightweight gel serum enriched with peptides and hyaluronic acid, hydrates and plumps the skin. The Barrier Restore Cream, a luxurious moisturizer infused with ceramides and antioxidants, soothes and repairs the skin barrier. Lastly, the Peptide Lip Treatment, a nourishing lip balm containing peptides and plant oils, smooths and softens the lips.</p><p>Hailey announced the brand's launch on her Instagram account, where she boasts over 49 million followers. Additionally, she created a dedicated Rhode account, which has amassed over 750,000 followers. She shared her skincare journey through these platforms and explained the motivation behind Rhode's creation.
