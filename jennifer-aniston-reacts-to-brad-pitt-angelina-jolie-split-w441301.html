Sources tell <i>Us Weekly</i> that the <i>Friends</i> alum, who was married to Pitt prior to his romance with Jolie, sees the <i>By the Sea</i> stars’ failed marriage somewhat as karma. Find out more in the video above, and detailed below!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-inline-08e139b7-f50f-4dfa-b4dd-f6b8bae16075.jpg><p>According to an insider, the <i>Mother’s Day</i> actress, 47, said, “Yeah, that’s karma for you!” while discussing the news with a longtime pal.</p><p>“She always got the sense that something would happen with them eventually,” the insider tells <i>Us</i>, noting that she did believe Pitt loved the Oscar-winning actress. “She didn’t feel that Angelina was truly the one who Brad was meant to stay with. She always felt that Angelina was too complex for him. He’s a pretty simple guy.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>A second source tells <i>Us</i> that while Aniston “admittedly feels sort of satisfied about Brad and Angelina’s split,” she also “never wanted this for them or wished this on them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-inline-c163024e-ee9e-42fe-aad0-cb425e58eeba.jpg><p>“Jen does wish Brad luck and the best. She feels like she’s happy, and she wants him to be happy too,” the second insider explains. “Jen does not hold on to any negativity from her marriage to Brad.”</p><p>Aniston has since moved on and married <b>Justin Theroux</b> in August 2015, 10 years after her split from Pitt. The <i>World War Z </i>star and Jolie, who went public with their romance following Pitt and Aniston’s January 2005 split and their on-set <i>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</i> romance, tied the knot after almost a decade together in August 2014.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On Monday, September 19, the <i>By the Sea</i> actress filed for divorce from the actor, citing irreconcilable differences. According to sources, the pair are calling it quits because they butted heads over how to raise their kids, among other issues.</p><p>“They fought a lot over the years and disagreed about many things,” the insider explained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0WaYp6GjqbyvedGemJyso2LBsHnBq5idZaCewbV5wKeenqSZo65uts6loJ5lo6W5qsCMsGttaWNlfnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fernanda-rocha-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Fernanda Rocha Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
