We just need to adapt."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=we-39-ve-got-new-rules>We've Got New Rules</h2><p>Sofia continues to say that, just as some protocols have existed for centuries, <a href=#>others need to be established today</a>, based on new developments.</p><p><strong>"Once upon a time, it was physically impossible to take a telephone to a social engagement,"</strong> she explains. <strong>"Now, <a href=#>our phones go everywhere with us</a>."</strong></p><p>Because of that, she concludes, <strong>"we just need to find the boundaries and limits to when we should use them,"</strong> - and based on many of Sofia's TikToks and Reels, it's safe to say that the table is not included in that list!</p><h2 id=sofia-responds-to-the-backlash-she-39-s-received>Sofia Responds To The Backlash She's Received</h2><p>Sofia boasts over 2 million followers on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> and 600k on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, so it's fair to say she has a massive fanbase!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, not even Sofia is immune to the haters, and many a detractor can be found in the comments sections of her posts.</p><p>Interestingly enough, though, the model doesn't take the criticism personally.

It's not necessary to be born rich or have the best clothes - everyone can act elegantly, no matter what background they have."</strong></p><p>Sofia drives home her point by sharing her favorite quote, by fashion designer Elie Saab: <strong>"elegance is a statement and an attitude."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-mission-and-a-vision-for-a-more-elegant-future>A Mission And A Vision For A More Elegant Future</h2><p>Regardless of her disparagers, Sofia is on a mission to make the world a more elegant place.</p><p><strong>"It's a pity that young generations don't learn etiquette at home or in social environments," </strong>she muses, adding that she wishes more people were taught the basics from a young age.</p><p>However, using her new platform to do it, Sofia's goal is to encourage young people to find the value in etiquette.</p><p><strong>"I'm going to fight to keep as motivate as many human beings as possible to follow good manners," </strong>she asserts.</p><p>After all, she concludes, <strong>"at the end of the day, etiquette is all about how you respect yourself and the person in front of you."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Exclusive: How Social Media Star Torry Hermann Is Using TikTok To Make A Difference</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsZucqsCqwsRmq6KjpKS4pr6MrKafoZFiuap5zqdksKCRqXqqwIyrnJqknK56rrHAp6pmrJ9ir6Z5xKWcoJmeqXpw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-jamie-lynn-sigler-first-husband-aj-discala-got-divorced.html><span>←</span><span>The Real Reason Jamie-Lynn Sigler And Her First Husband AJ Discala Got Divorced</span></a>
