She appeared in multiple print advertising campaigns and national commercials as a toddler and moved to Los Angeles with her mother at age 11. She received minor TV spots in shows until she landed a prominent supporting role in <i>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</i>. The role helped her receive notoriety and lead to coming-of-age adolescent projects such as <i>American Pie</i>. She appeared in stage productions and movies until she landed her most famous role as Lily Aldrin in<i> How I Met Your Mother</i>. The show ran for nine seasons, and the actress made $5.4 million per season along with syndication royalties. <a href=#>With a net worth of $40 million, Alyson Hannigan has invested a sizable amount in real estate</a>.</p><p>The actress has lived in Los Angeles for decades, so it’s not surprising that she decided to raise her children in the same city alongside her husband, Alexis Denisof. One of their most famous properties is an Encino home worth $18 million, often used as a set location for many shows. Let’s take a look inside the picturesque property.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-twist-of-modern-and-contemporary>A Twist Of Modern And Contemporary</h2><p>Named the Sherman Residence, the property is located in the exclusive Encino neighborhood of San Fernando Valley. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>, Peter Tolkin built the prized compound in 2001. The architect is also known for designing the Saladang Garden restaurant in Pasadena and Malibu’s Sunglass House. The home's structure consists of various pavilions made from glass, wood, and concrete. Alyson Hannigan and Alexis Denisof purchased the property in 2016 for $7.95 million. The home's value doubled within six years with the growing popularity of expensive neighborhoods and sought-after structures.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Crazy Details You Never Knew About Alyson Hannigan's Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After staying on the market for a few months, David Lebensfeld, an industry executive, purchased the home, making it one of the most expensive real estate purchases in Encino. Michael LaMontagne of Hilton & Hyland held the listing alongside Coldwell Banker and Alexis LaMontagne, who provided details of the completed contract, as noted by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>. Hannigan and Denisof customized the 5-bedroom, 8-bathroom house with their preference after purchasing the property in 2016, which included making cosmetic updates to the interior and making the outdoors kid-friendly for the young family.</p><h2 id=a-seamless-design>A Seamless Design</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The charming home is tucked away on </a>a 3-acre land with gated security and lush foliage. Hannigan’s hillside property has 6,500 square feet of primary residence, which feature high-wood beam ceilings, poured-concrete walls, limestone flooring, and light wooden fixtures. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, the Sherman Residence has glass walls surrounding each perimeter of the home to drench spaces in sunlight and create an environment that merges the indoors with the outdoors. The living, formal living room has a skylight and a traditional fireplace alongside comfortable seating areas, while the family room has a large mural with an electric fireplace.</p><p>A chef's kitchen is next to the family room, stocked with high-end stainless steel appliances and an eat-in kitchen island. It also showcases a breakfast nook for an intimate yet cozy family dinner. The room also features a formal dining room for hosting members and a screening room for entertainment. The Master Suite is equally stunning as the recreational rooms, with an adjoining office and an ensuite bathroom. The bathroom has spa-inspired decor, an ample shower space, and a soaking steel bathtub. Additionally, Hannigan and Denisof’s property offers various features outside the primary residence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-californian-dream>The Californian Dream</h2><p>Adjacent to the main property is a one-bedroom guesthouse made with similar decor and design as the residence. It features one bedroom, a full bath, an office, and a kitchen. The guesthouse also has a spare room that can be converted into a gym or an art studio. Attached to the one-bedroom detached residence is a glass-encased three-car garage. Outdoors, the house is an architectural delight with various nooks and sports for lounging and enjoying the day in the heat. The sprawling patio has an al fresco dining area to have a meal out in the sun and ample space to host barbecue nights.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, the home also has an expansive pool with a spa. While not many homes offer spaces for outdoor activities, <a href=#>Hannigan’s property also comes with a tennis court</a> and viewing platform to spend a day playing racket. The property is an architectural dream, and many production companies have used it as a location to shoot scenes. Sherman Residence was featured in shows such as <i>Agents Of SHIELD</i> and <i>Fun With Dick and Jane</i>, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>. More recently, the property was seen in the last episode of the final season of <i>This Is Us</i>. Hannigan stated that the production company paid her a rental fee and repaired minor damages.</p><p>Alyson Hannigan’s Encino home is a Californian dream home which is one of the reasons why it has been featured in many projects over the years. Using the best elements to create an interior, the mansion is a contemporary paradise as an ideal family home. The house is expected to go through minor tweaks under the new ownership.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside John Travolta's Multi-Million-Dollar Private Jet</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaipqOesaZ5x6KksqVdqMGivoyao7Krn6N6qa3Np6CgmZ6oenKEjKagpaSZpLtusc2coKenXZ28rrGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-strahan-messy-divorce-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>How Michael Strahan's Messy Divorce Negatively Affected His Once-Impressive Net Worth</span></a>
