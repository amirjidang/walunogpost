The two have been together for 13 years this year and are still so unbelievably in love with each other. Their relationship hasn't been perfect, but then again the best ones never are. It has been a journey full of love and discovery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there's not much - if any - negativity surrounding the two, there are some things that many wouldn't guess about their relationship. It's a special one to say the least, and we're happy to share what we know about this king and queen of country music and drama.</p><p>Here are 20 things that might be surprising about these two! If nothing else, they make us believe that true love really does exist out there.</p><h2 id=while-keith-is-obviously-musical-kidman-isn-t-too-shabby><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>While Keith Is Obviously Musical, Kidman Isn't Too Shabby</span></h2><p>The two have been scoped on more than one occasion <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">singing</a> with each other, including car karaoke! Keith jokes about his wife, saying that if she heckles him, he makes her sing with him...as he did at an event they attended for Spotify.</p><h2 id=kidman-made-a-special-country-music-cd-to-play-during-labor><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Kidman Made A Special Country Music CD&nbsp;To Play During&nbsp;Labor</span></h2><p>While the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CD</a> didn't include any of her singing, it did include some of Keith's music. It's the sweetest thing to sing to your child, and playing songs for a baby, which have been chosen with love, as soon as the infant enters the world, is truly something else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-didn-t-begin-dating-immediately><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>They Didn't Begin Dating Immediately</span></h2><p>Funnily enough, the couple didn't begin <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dating</a> immediately. It took Keith four months to ask Nicole out, but they did know each other prior to that. While she claims there were no intense sparks, it's clear that there was still something there. Enough to build a romance on, anyway!</p><h2 id=but-they-did-meet-at-a-gala-for-aussies><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>But They Did Meet At A Gala For Aussies</span></h2><p>Although Nicole Kidman was born in Hawaii, she's still <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Australian</a> and so is Keith. This is something they both have in common and care deeply about, and they even have a home&nbsp;in Sydney. They met at a G'Day LA event and&nbsp;began dating several months later.</p><h2 id=they-broke-tradition-with-their-wedding-gifts><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>They Broke Tradition With Their Wedding Gifts</span></h2><p>Typically at weddings, the bride and groom's family and friends will offer gifts and/or cards when they attend the ceremony. In stark contrast to tradition, both Nicole and Keith requested that their guests <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">donate</a> money to the Sydney Children's Hospital rather than using it for gifts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-first-meeting-wasn-t-earth-shaking-according-to-kidman><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Their First Meeting Wasn't 'Earth Shaking' According to Kidman</span></h2><p>Although they joke about it, Nicole claims that Keith definitely wasn't in love right off the bat and that it wasn't '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">love</a> at first sight'. Obviously, there was something there, and although it wasn't 'earth-shaking', it would definitely prove to be a love that would transcend the years.</p><h2 id=kidman-didn-t-mind-moving-fast-and-getting-married-early><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Kidman Didn't Mind Moving Fast And Getting Married Early</span></h2><p>Nicole told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> in an interview that she doesn't mind moving quickly as far as marriage goes. For her, it's better to marry someone and get to know them while married, rather than taking the long road to doing so. She knew she wanted to marry Keith after about a month!</p><h2 id=urban-carried-a-secret-that-initially-put-a-strain-on-their-marriage><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Urban&nbsp;Carried A Secret That Initially Put A Strain On Their Marriage</span></h2><p>Keith had a substance <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">issue</a> that definitely put a strain on their relationship. While he checked himself into rehab immediately after they were married, he claims Nicole was a huge driving force behind that. While it was a tremendous difficulty for her to overcome, he didn't want to lose everything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-were-admittedly-both-very-lonely-individuals><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>They Were Admittedly Both Very Lonely Individuals</span></h2><p>The two have claimed that they believed they were both very <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lonely</a> prior to meeting each other. It's interesting how, despite being surrounded by so many fans and the big lights of Hollywood, you can still feel so alone. It seems these two really found their soul mates in each other.</p><h2 id=the-two-feel-as-though-there-was-a-powerful-driving-force-to-their-love><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>The Two Feel As Though There Was A Powerful, Driving Force To Their Love</span></h2><p>While some believe that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">love</a> is simply the recognition of something we like in another person, others believe the aspect of fate has a big role to play in it. Both Nicole and Keith believe that there was a driving force behind their love and that they didn't just end up together by accident.</p><h2 id=neither-of-them-uses-texts-to-contact-the-other><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Neither Of Them Uses Texts To Contact The Other</span></h2><p>An interesting tidbit about their relationship is that neither <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">texts</a> or email have a place in their world. The two aren't likely to contact each other unless it's via telephone. Nicole says that if they do text, it will usually be one of them expressing a need to hear the other's voice.</p><h2 id=but-they-will-send-one-spicy-text-occasionally><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>But They Will Send One Spicy Text Occasionally</span></h2><p>According to Keith, the couple has been known to send some pretty <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">steamy</a> texts maybe once a year. Understandably, they both miss one another when one or both of them are away for work, and they are human. Texting is good for at least one thing, it seems!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marriage-will-always-be-their-number-one-priority-above-all-else><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Marriage Will Always Be Their Number One Priority, Above All Else</span></h2><p>This is how the two claim they've done so well up to this point. Their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">marriage</a> will always come first, before their personal wants, as well as their careers. When you find someone you truly want to spend forever with, it's easy to put their needs ahead of everything else.</p><h2 id=from-speeding-away-at-90-mph-to-talking-out-their-problems-they-both-learned><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>From Speeding Away At 90 MPH To Talking Out Their Problems: They Both Learned</span></h2><p>Whereas Keith used to speed away from the house in his car at 90 MPH when he didn't understand what Nicole wanted, he has since learned to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">anticipate</a> her needs. He says that a lot of it is just knowing when she needs him to be there for her, which is what his song 'Fighter' is about.</p><h2 id=urban-is-extremely-supportive-of-his-wife-and-understands-creative-liberty><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Urban Is Extremely Supportive Of His Wife And Understands Creative Liberty</span></h2><p>Nicole Kidman has taken on some pretty intense roles, as is the life of such a successful and talented actress. However, it's just as important for her to have a husband who supports her, which Keith does flawlessly. As such, she supports his music career just as much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-was-also-very-sensitive-to-kidman-s-role-in-big-little-lies><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Was Also Very Sensitive To Kidman's Role In&nbsp;Big Little Lies</span></h2><p>In an interview with W Magazine, Nicole said that her husband was very sensitive when it came to her role in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Little Lies</a>. She claimed it was tough for him to watch, considering how much her character had to deal with from her on-screen husband. We're guessing it would be tough for anyone to watch their partner go through that, acting or not.</p><h2 id=kidman-relies-on-urban-to-be-her-emotional-support-post-filming><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kidman Relies On Urban To Be Her Emotional Support Post-Filming</span></h2><p>Just as Keith dealt with a bit of emotion when watching his wife take on a challenging role, she also depended on him to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">support</a> her afterwards. She says that she would come home and simply just need him to be there for her, as it was both emotionally and physically taxing.</p><h2 id=the-two-have-specific-stances-for-taking-photos><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Two Have Specific Stances For Taking Photos</span></h2><p>Since Nicole is taller than Keith (which is obvious in some photos of the couple), the two have perfected their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stance</a>. Keith will either wear shoes that give him some extra height, or Nicole will alter her stance to match his height. It could mean slouching a bit, leaning her head in, or simply wearing longer dresses to hide how tall she is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-share-one-mantra><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Share One Mantra</span></h2><p>'Nothing to hide and everything to protect' is the couple's constant <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mantra</a>. It's a good thing to believe in and truly describe their relationship to a T. The two have fought for what they have and, just like anyone else, they're human and keen on protecting what they've built.</p><h2 id=the-two-encourage-leaving-one-another-s-comfort-zones><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Two Encourage Leaving One Another's Comfort Zones</span></h2><p>Whether it's singing on stage or taking on a new role, both Keith and Nicole are constantly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">encouraging</a> each other. The support they have for one another is truly admirable and it's why they're able to experience so many different things, despite their own personal fears.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhpaWWlo8K0wcClZJ%2BZk6nAbrfEoquhZaWnr6K6jJqlnWWenrCwuMRmoqKcnZa7brDOp6tmq5iWv6Z5wJumrqxdqbWmtdFmpJqqop6uqLGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-images-of-peyton-roi-lists-transformation-from-disney-to-it-girl.html><span>←</span><span>20 Images Of Peyton Roi Lists Transformation From Disney To It Girl</span></a>
