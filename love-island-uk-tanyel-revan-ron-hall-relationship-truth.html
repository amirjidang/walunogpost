Strong relationships were formed from the onset, leaving fans yearning for a change of pace with the impending doom that is Casa Amore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, even before Casa, much of the season's drama was attributed to runner-up, Ron Hall, whose head remained on a swivel despite earning unwavering loyalty from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">now-girlfriend, Lana Jenkins</a>. TheThings spoke with villa favorite, Tanyel Revan, about her will-they-won't-they relationship with Ron, and the Love Island Instagram ban.</p><h2 id=did-tanyel-ever-have-feelings-for-ron>Did Tanyel Ever Have Feelings For Ron?</h2><p>Along with 4 other bombshells, Tanyel was one of the first ladies to cross viewers' screens during the season premiere. The North London hairstylist began her journey coupled up with Kai, though she admittedly also had her eye on Ron. Though coupled up with Lana, it seemed sexual tension lingered between Ron and Tanyel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eventually finding themselves coupled up, the other islanders seemed to hint at the possibility of something romantic forming between Tanyel and Ron. But what were Tanyel's thoughts on the situationship?</p><p>"In the beginning, I said... to everyone my top 2 are Kai and Ron and I made it very clear because I wanted to start with honesty, so it wasn’t sly, or I wasn't going behind people backs. I knew he was good-looking... I fancied him a bit because we got on, but once we coupled up we couldn’t even flirt, it just went out the window. It was just awkward to think of us being anything more than friends. I started to realize little things like wanting to support him and Lana rather than being jealous or envious. I was really happy for them, and at that point Lana and I started to grow a closer friendship, we just got to know each other really well, we really got on."</p><p>Suffice it to say, you Ron-yel lovers can hang up your signs.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dom And Inez Didn't Wind Up Together, But Are They The Real Perfect Match?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-public-and-the-ban>The Public and The Ban</h2><p>Having been approached to join the season 9 cast through an Instagram DM (direct message), Tanyel was equally apprehensive and excited to embark on her Love Island adventure. Throughout her time in the villa, Tanyel made a pact to herself to remain positive, true, and transparent, taking away life lessons that have continued to shape the individual she is today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had a really good experience, it pushed me out of my comfort zone... It’s just nice to do something like that, you learn a lot about yourself when you don’t have a phone, and you’re away from everyone you’re used to. It reassured me as a person, I think I really know who I am now even more coming out of the show."</p><p>Having been dumped from the island on Day 24, Tanyel recalls the attention she received - and continues to receive - after stepping off the plane.</p><p>"People were walking up to me in the airport, everyone was so supportive of me and so positive... Everything on social media was so positive, it was so nice to see. People can see me for who I am because there’s only so much you can change."</p><p>Tanyel's positive experience coming out of the villa segued us into another topic: social media takeovers. In previous seasons, family and friends were allowed to take over islanders' Instagram accounts during their time in the villa. <a href=# rel=nofollow>For season 9, however, producers disallowed use of islanders' accounts</a>, concluding that the change would serve to protect contestants and their loved ones from online hate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Netflix Star Chloe Veitch Opens Up About Stepping Back From Reality TV</a></span></p><p>So, what were Tanyel's thoughts?</p><p>"I think they need to get rid of that ban. This is just my personal view on things... I’m quite thick-skinned, people are either going to love me or hate me or just not care... It doesn’t stop people from posting on their own accounts... I see where they were coming from and how it could help, but for me, I’m none the wiser... People are also allowed to have their opinions and those opinions are still going to be all over social media, they can still comment if they want. My family and friends still saw everything, sometimes it’s good to see what people say for self-improvement."</p><p>In addition to the ban's inability to shield islanders from trolls, the decision brought with it a lack of account traction. For example, Sanam has only amassed 402k followers, whereas <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Season 8 winner, Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu</a>, came away from her time on Love Island with 3 million followers. The question then remains: are these factors enough to consider reversing the ruling?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Did Val Bragg's Scandal With Chase Stokes And Madelyn Cline Increase Her Love Island USA Fame?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijqK6VYra0uMCnm2atm2LBorrYnqNmqpWrrq950ailZqCRobluvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZqurraSdfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-rappers-say-about-kendrick-lamars-new-album-mr-morale-and-the-big-steppers-eminem.html><span>←</span><span>Eminem And 6 Other Rappers Expressed This About Kendrick Lamar's Newest Album</span></a>
