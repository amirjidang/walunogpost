And she's proven that she's not afraid of what comes with the spotlight. Time after time, she has confronted the press and has been exceptionally honest about both <a href=#>the true meaning</a> of her <a href=#>music</a> and what's going on with her relationships. Yet, at the time of this writing, she hasn't sat down with arguably the greatest celebrity interviewer, <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, the former shock jock has pushed a lot of buttons throughout his career, but he has interviewed some of the biggest music legends of all time. While Swift may be avoiding the Stern Show, she did make a mysterious donation to the self-proclaimed King of All Media and his wife's animal charity.</p><h2 id=what-is-howard-and-beth-stern-39-s-animal-charity>What Is Howard And Beth Stern's Animal Charity?</h2><p>Howard Stern and his wife Beth are incredibly philanthropic. Given the radio legend's $650 million net worth, there's no doubt that he is capable of making a lot of positive change in the world. While Stern has a lot of philanthropic interests, he focuses his efforts and finances on rescuing, fostering, and adopting cats. In fact, he usually has upwards of 20 cats in his own home. However, it is his wife, Beth who runs the show. And she does this through <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her very own animal charity, Beth's Furry Friends</a>.</p><p>It's Beth who is obsessed with cats.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/howard-stern-wife-beth-stern-north-shore-animal-league-charity.jpg><p>Beth Stern is a board member of North Shore Animal League America, as well as a tireless spokesperson for the organization and her very own charity within it. Initially, Bianca's Furry Friends Feline Adoption Center, Beth's Furry Friends has helped care, spay or neuter, foster, and facilitated adoptions for well over 2,000 "unwanted" cats, according to her website.</p><p>But her association with the world's largest no-kill shelter is not the end of Beth's animal rescue. Through Beth's Furry Friends, Howard Stern's wife will personally rescue and adopt cats. She's not some person just writing the cheque. She is on the ground and has devoted her life to the cause.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Scooter Braun's Net Worth Tank After Angering Taylor Swift Or Did Their Feud Propel Him To Become The Biggest Music Executive In The Business?</a></span></p><p>This also includes writing New York Times Best Selling books, "Oh My Dog!" and "Yoda: the Story of a Cat and his Kittens", and "Yoda Gets a Buddy", all of the profits of which have gone right back into animal rescue. The same is true for the various totes and products she sells.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/howard-stern-wife-beth-stern-paparazzi.jpg><p>Howard Stern has been instrumental in his wife's charity work. Not only does he provide her with the funds, but he physically helps her foster cats in their home. He also frequently gives her a national platform to promote her charity. He's also connected her with other celebrities who care about animal rescue, including John Stamos, Billy Joel, and Jon Bon Jovi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And then there's Taylor Swift...</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-made-a-huge-donation-to-howard-and-beth-stern-39-s-animal-charity>Taylor Swift Made A Huge Donation To Howard And Beth Stern's Animal Charity</h2><p>Fans of Taylor Swift know that she's a humungous cat person. There are even rumors that <a href=#>Swift's cats have a higher net worth than her ex-boyfriend, actor Joe Alwyn</a>. So it's not entirely surprising that she would support one of the most notable feline charities in the United States. And that charitable organization just so happens to be the baby of Howard Stern's wife, Beth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/do-taylor-swift-s-cats-have-a-higher-net-worth-than-her-ex-boyfriends_-here-s-the-ridiculous-truth-about-her-rich-felines.jpg><p>"Did I ever say... Taylor Swift, what she did with Beth? Did I ever talk about that?" Howard Stern asked his co-host Robin Quivers on June 5th, 2023 while on air.</p><p>"No," Quivers responded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm don't know if I'm allowed to say," Stern continued. "I don't know if I was embargoed. I forget. I don't care. She was very, very generous. Let's put it that way. With helping out the cause."</p><p>"So, you're a Swiftie!" Quivers said.</p><p>"I'm a Swiftie. Oh, f*** yeah. I like people who put up. There's a lot of talk around here. But Taylor Swift put up," Stern claimed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Billboard</a>, Taylor Swift did indeed "put up". In December 2022, alongside a photo a cute kitty, Beth Stern revealed on social media that Swift made a huge donation to Beth's Furry Friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/untitled-design-1-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[This cat's] name is Angel Taylor in honor of recent birthday girl, Taylor Swift who sent me a sizable donation to Beth’s Furry Friends to help me save more lives.”</p><p>The cat arrived in the States from Oman the same day that Swift sent her "large" donation to Beth's Furry Friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Despite Being Worth $650 Million, Howard Stern Made SiriusXM Pay For Multiple Miami Hotel Rooms For Just He And His Wife</a></span></p><p>"Kitty Angel Taylor is currently being assessed at my specialist vet hospital," Sternsaid her post.

But given Beth's social media following and the frequency of the animal charity being brought up on The Stern Show, it's likely that Swift heard of the incredible reputation that the Stern family has for rescuing, fostering, and adopting out stray cats.</p><h2 id=check-out-how-taylor-swift-got-so-successful>Check Out How Taylor Swift Got So Successful</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for why Taylor Swift didn't seem to want the world to know about her donation, it appears as though she simply didn't want to gloat. While some may believe that she didn't want to publicly associate with Howard Stern, there's no evidence that backs this up.</p><h2 id=the-truth-about-howard-stern-and-taylor-swift-39-s-relationship>The Truth About Howard Stern And Taylor Swift's Relationship</h2><p>Aside from the mysterious donation to Beth's Furry Friends, Taylor Swift has not had anything to do with Howard Stern publicly. Nor has she said anything about him online or to the press. According to the Stern Show, her management has been contacted multiple times by producer Gary Dell'Abate who had hoped to get her on the acclaimed radio show. But, at the time of this writing, these attempts have been unsuccessful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-design-(11).jpg><p>Howard Stern has also stated on air that he would like to sit down with Swift for an interview, despite not knowing her music. The radio legend has also been somewhat critical of Swift in the past, including suggesting that people stay away from the pop singer lest they want her to tear them apart in her music.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Howard Stern Thinks Everyone Should Stay Away From Taylor Swift</a></span></p><p>But both Stern and how longtime co-host Robin Quivers have also praised Swift's beauty and for standing up for her political beliefs regardless of the backlash. They've also spoken at length about how impressive Swift's career is. While her music may not be Stern's jam, he has various staff members who are obsessive fans of hers. So, he gets it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether this will be enough to convince Swift to come on the show and sit down for a tell-all with the talented interviewer remains to be seen...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1ll5bDpnnMqKWesV2dvLit0Z1krKyVp7tuw8ifnGaalam1tHnAp6CmmZxisKmt0aKrsmWnncZuw8CsZJplo5qws7HTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shuwanza-goff-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-53992-html.html><span>←</span><span>Shuwanza Goff Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
