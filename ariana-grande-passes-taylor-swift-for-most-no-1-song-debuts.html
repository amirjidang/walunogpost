It was Grande’s seventh song to come in at the top spot, pushing her past Swift, 34, and every other female artist in history.</p><p>Grande’s list of songs debuting at No. 1 now includes “Thank U, Next” and “7 Rings” (from Thank U, Next); “Stuck With U” and “Rain on Me,” her 2020 collabs with <strong>Justin Bieber</strong> and <strong>Lady Gaga</strong>, respectively; “Positions,” the title track from her 2020 album and the first two singles from Eternal Sunshine, “<a href=#>Yes, And?</a>” and “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love).”</p><p>If there is any consolation for Swifties, Swift will likely tie Grande when she releases the first single from her upcoming album,<a href=#> The Tortured Poets Department</a>, which drops on Friday, April 19.</p><p>The love Swift’s fans have for her music will likely propel any new song to the top, meaning she’ll add to her six No. 1 debuts: 2014’s “Shake It Off,” “Cardigan” and “Willow” from 2020’s Folklore and Evermore, “All Too Well (Taylor’s Version),” “Anti-Hero” from Midnights and Swift’s most recent No. 1 debut, “Is It Over Now?”</p><p>Both Swift and Grande are chasing <strong>Drake</strong>, who has nine No. 1 song debuts. His list of chart-toppers includes solo songs “God’s Plan, “Nice for What,” “Toosie Slide” and “What’s Next,” the collabs “Way 2 Sexy” with <strong>Future</strong> and <strong>Young Thug</strong>, Future’s “Wait for U” (featuring <strong>Tems</strong>), “Jimmy Cooks” with 21 <strong>Savage</strong> from Honestly, Nevermind and his singles from For All the Dogs, “Slime You Out” (featuring <strong>SZA</strong>) and “First Person Shooter” (featuring <strong>J. Cole</strong>).</p><p>Swift and Drake, 37, also hold an edge over Grande in terms of <a href=#>overall Hot 100 No. 1s</a>. “We Can’t Be Friends” is Grande’s ninth song to reach No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Meanwhile, Swift already has 11 (including “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” “Blank Space,” “Bad Blood,” “Look What You Made Me Do” and “Cruel Summer.”)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Drake has 13 songs that have reached the No. 1 position, including two with <strong>Rihanna</strong> (“Work,” “What’s My Name?”), “One Dance” with <strong>Wizkid</strong> and <strong>Kyla</strong> and his solo song “In My Feelings.”</p><p>On Monday, March 18, Grande expressed her gratitude for having the No. 1 song and album in America. “It’s impossible to put into words what I’ve been feeling this week,” she wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>. “[Eternal Sunshine] is <a href=#>most special to me</a> for many reasons and just holds so much. Sharing it has re-opened a lot of little and <a href=#>big feelings alike</a> and it has been an emotional week in many ways.”</p><p>“But your overwhelmingly loving response to it all has made me feel such joyful, human connection and comfort,” she added. “Just wanted to say I love and appreciate you all more than one can say and thank you again. It is, as it always has been, my greatest honor to grow with you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJiroZGjrm6z0ZqlnZ1dpa60v8SsZK2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2bvLN5zKiqrWWepHpyedKopaBllJqvtsDSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anaiya-bell-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-60703-html.html><span>←</span><span>Anaya Bell Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
