Some of his movies <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have done significantly well</a> and afforded Depp the good life. But plenty of his movies have flopped, too.</p><p>The actor doesn’t seem to mind, and that’s part of his charm. He always seems to be known for and respected for his quirkiness and fearlessness when taking on roles, and he takes inspiration from strange places. For example, he channeled Withnail for Sleepy Hollow and President Bush for Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. Here are 10 Facts You Never Knew About Johnny Depp.</p><h2 id=saved-a-horse-from-the-glue-factory>Saved A Horse From The Glue Factory</h2><p>During the filming of Sleepy Hollow, Depp learned how to ride a horse, Goldeneye for his role as Ichabod Crane. The horse played Crane’s steed, Gunpowder.</p><p>Once Depp heard that the horse was going to be put down, the connection he had to the horse was undeniable. He decided to adopt it to save it from presumably heading to the glue factory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oprah-noodlemantra-and-other-merry-antics>Oprah Noodlemantra And Other Merry Antics</h2><p>One thing is for sure about Depp, he doesn’t take himself very seriously and wants his coworkers to share that sentiment too. As Wes Craven decided to use stock footage of Depp from the first Nightmare On Elm Street and incorporate into The Final Nightmare, Depp used the the credited name of Oprah Noodlemantra.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Lowest-Grossing Johnny Depp Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><p>That’s just some of the antics Depp likes to pull. On the set of What’s Eating Gilbert Grape, he bet co-star Leonardo DiCaprio to sniff a rancid pickled egg and lost 500 bucks. After hearing that Faye Dunaway never used a trampoline before, he brought one to the set of Arizona Dream to play with.</p><h2 id=captain-jack-is-never-far-away>Captain Jack Is Never Far Away</h2><p>Johnny Depp was a respected actor and still is to this day. But he struck a huge chord with the masses for his portrayal of <a href=#>Captain Jack Sparrow in The Pirates Of The Caribbean </a>movies. The first movie even netted him a Best Actor nomination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depp loves the role so much that he has played him in six different movies. The kids also love Captain Jack and Depp loves entertaining children. He keeps the costume with him wherever he goes and will occasionally visit sick children in hospitals in full regalia.</p><h2 id=donated-his-salary-to-matilda-ledger>Donated His Salary To Matilda Ledger</h2><p>While the late Heath Ledger and Johnny Depp never met, they were certainly kindred spirits. After the actor’s unfortunate passing, Terry Gilliam reached out to not only Depp, but Colin Farrell and Jude Law to help complete Ledger’s last role in the Imiganarium Of Doctor Parnassus.</p><p>Depp suggested that all three actors donate their salary to Heath’s daughter Matilda as a tribute to the late actor.</p><h2 id=an-accomplished-musician>An Accomplished Musician</h2><p>During his formative years, Johnny Depp wanted to be a <a href=#>rock star</a> (something several actors have dabbled with). He not only played in bands but got to open for Iggy Pop too.</p><p>Over the years, Depp has played in several groups, including The Hollywood Vampires; featuring him, Aerosmith’s guitarist, Joe Perry; and the initial group’s founder, Alice Cooper. He has also played guitar on the Oasis track, “Fade In-Out.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=people-s-sexiest-man-alive-twice>People’s Sexiest Man Alive, Twice</h2><p>For a guy who tends to shun and even thumb his nose at the very notion of celebrity, Depp has also been one of the only actors to land on the cover of “People’s Sexiest Man Alive” issue, not once but twice in 2003 and 2009.</p><p>It’s not surprising given his status as a cultural icon and someone a lot of ladies and some guys happen to idolize.</p><h2 id=friends-with-nicolas-cage>Friends With Nicolas Cage</h2><p>You seldom see any stories or pictures revolving around Depp and Nicolas Cage, but it was actually Cage who convinced Johnny Depp to get into acting. In 1983, at just twenty years old, Depp got hitched to a make-up artist, Lori Anne Wilson.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Johnny Depp Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Wilson was the one who introduced the two and then his role in A Nightmare On Elm Street came shortly after. The two remained close and Depp even offered to help bail Cage out of some financial troubles several years prior.</p><h2 id=encouraged-to-drop-out-of-school>Encouraged To Drop Out Of School</h2><p>More than several stars over the years dropped out of high school and headed straight for their dreams. But it’s not every day that the school encourages you to do it! As he was fronting the Garage Band, The Kids, Depp dropped out of High School to pursue rock-god glory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Depp did come around and realize the importance of a high school education. He tried to come back two weeks later, only for the principal to actually not let him and encouraged him to work hard towards his dreams instead.</p><h2 id=blame-the-armadillo>Blame The Armadillo</h2><p>During the nineties, as Depp’s stock was as rising as an actor, his propensity for living the rock star life was growing as well. He was dating a supermodel, Kate Moss and seemed to be enjoying the volatile relationship and trashing hotel rooms across the world. In 1994, he was arrested for destroying a room at The Mark in New York.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Johnny Depp Bought</a></span></p><p>Instead of owing up to causing a ruckus, Depp blamed the incident on armadillo that got loose in the room. To this day, the culprit hasn’t been found. So, if you’re waiting for a train in the Big Apple and see this little guy scurrying around amongst the rats, please let the authorities know.</p><h2 id=funded-hunter-s-thompson-s-last-blast>Funded Hunter S. Thompson’s Last Blast</h2><p>In 1998, Depp met with and befriended the gonzo journalist, Hunter S. Thompson while preparing to play him in Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. Their friendship would continue on even past the author’s death. Depp funded his funeral, which was attended by fellow journalists like Ed Bradley, friends like Jack Nicholson and Bill Murray; who also played Thompson in the film, Where The Buffalo Roam.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depp told the <a href=#>Associated Press</a>, "All I'm doing is trying to make sure his last wish comes true. I just want to send my pal out the way he wants to go out."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Love Watching Reality TV</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nmqS1r7rYZpueqKBis6Kv06xkraqZq7aiedSnoqenp6N8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-who-refuse-to-do-superhero-movies-why.html><span>←</span><span>10 Celebrities Who Refuse To Do Superhero Movies (&amp;amp; Why)</span></a>
