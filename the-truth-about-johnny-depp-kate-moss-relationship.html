Depp was 31 while Moss was 20. They were introduced by columnist George Wayne. "It was The GW who introduced Kate Moss to Johnny Depp," he wrote in an Instagram post. "One fateful night mid 90's at Cafe Tabsc which was the supermodel hangout back in the day! Johnny was in the back having dinner and Kate walked in with Naomi and The GW grabbed her and made the introduction! I had no idea that they would then become the IT couple for seasons to come ….destroying hotel rooms across the globe during their still unforgettable union!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The attraction was instant between the two. "I knew from the first moment we talked that we were going to be together," Moss said of their first encounter. The couple became inseparable since then. "They can't keep their hands, lips, mouths, legs off of each other," a source close to Depp said of their shameless PDAs that year. But in 2012, the supermodel admitted that their relationship soon turned into a "nightmare."</p><p>"There's nobody that's ever really been able to take care of me. Johnny did for a bit. I believed what he said. Like if I said, 'What do I do?' he'd tell me. And that's what I missed when I left," Moss told Vanity Fair at the time. "I really lost that gauge of somebody I could trust. Nightmare. Years and years of crying. Oh, the tears!"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Does Keanu Reeves Think Of Johnny Depp?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-johnny-depp-amp-kate-moss-break-up>Why Did Johnny Depp & Kate Moss Break Up?</h2><p>The glamorous-grunge couple called it quits in 1998. But things started to get messy early on in their relationship. In 1994, Depp was arrested for trashing a hotel room while Moss was inside. Back then, they were also photographed shouting at each other in public. The Dark Shadows star was arrested by police authorities at 5:30 AM at Mark Hotel in New York. Moss wasn't hurt during the incident but Depp was reportedly "in a state of possible toxication." A criminal court eventually dismissed the charges placed on the actor after he paid the hotel a total of $9,767.12.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think Johnny obviously has a temper. But this is a very minor incident. The room service must have been bad," Depp's director friend John Waltz said at the time. In 1998, the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory star admitted to Hello! Magazine that his split from Moss was all his fault. "I have never got that emotional over a woman before," he told the publication. "I have been so stupid because we had so much going for our relationship. I'm the one who has to take responsibility for what happened—I was difficult to get on with, I let my work get in the way, and I didn't give her the attention I should have."</p><p>Depp added that he was also dealing with work-related stress back then. "The whole thing was crazy because I should never have got so worked up over what people had to say about my work," he continued. "Sure I should care about my movies, but when I get home I should try to leave that stuff behind. I couldn't do that and I was horrific to live with. Trust me, I'm a total moron at times."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jennifer Grey Slams Ex Johnny Depp As 'Crazy, Paranoid'</a></span></p><h2 id=what-does-kate-moss-think-about-amber-heard-39-s-abuse-claims-against-johnny-depp>What Does Kate Moss Think About Amber Heard's Abuse Claims Against Johnny Depp?</h2><p>In 2020, Heard admitted to striking Depp once because she thought he was going to push her sister down some stairs after he "hit both myself and my sister." The actress also claimed that her ex-husband had done it to Moss before. "I did strike Johnny that day in defence of my sister," Heard testified. "He was about to push her down the stairs and, the moment before that happened, I remembered information I had heard [that] he pushed a former girlfriend - I believe it was Kate Moss - down the stairs."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had heard this rumour from two people and it was fresh in my mind," she continued. "In a flash I reacted in defense of her." Depp's lawyer, Eleanor Laws called out Heard for adding Moss into her changing story. "You have added the detail about Kate Moss. It's not contained in any document,' said Laws. "You did not mention anything about Kate Moss being in your mind. You are just making this up as you go along. This is the first time that you have mentioned it." The supermodel has never commented on the claims or anything related to Depp's defamation suit.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What The Cast Of ‘Pirates Of The Caribbean’ Has Said About Johnny Depp</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6q7vHp6WyZZSavbF5ypqrnmWdpMC0edGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-sudeikis-relationship-with-his-daughter-daisy-josephine-after-olivia-wilde-breakup.html><span>←</span><span>The Honest Truth About Jason Sudeikis' Relationship With His Daughter Daisy Josephine Sudeikis After</span></a>
