I’m 38. By the time I’m 45, you guys are going to be telling a completely different story.”</p><p>And recently, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he sat down with CBS Mornings</a> co-host Gayle King at his HartBeat Studios in Los Angeles to explain that it wasn’t about being rich. Hart says it was about the meaning behind the title, having ambitious goals, and the messages he hopes it sends to kids who are told it isn’t possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RELATED: <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2021's Top 4 Richest Stand Up Comedians In The World</a></p><p>“It’s not about the money, It’s about the title of a billionaire.” He told King. “It’s about what does that mean and how did you get there. What was your road to getting there?”</p><p>The mogul in the making explained that the title of billionaire sent a message to kids growing up in the inner cities. Hart says that it is an environment where people believe that opportunities are limited. The Fatherhood actor, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who grew up in a single-parent household</a> in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said by to become a billionaire would show those kids that it was possible for them as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I want to be known as a guy who took advantage of all opportunities that were presented, and found opportunities that weren’t presented and took advantage of those too,” the Ride Along star told King.</p><p>Hart still has a bit of work to do if he plans on reaching his goal, but the comedian is far from going broke. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth has his fortune pegged at $200 million</a> right now. It’s reported that he raked in $40 million last year alone, and his films have grossed over $1 billion at the box office.</p><p>“It sounds so crazy, but if you don’t have the mentality of ‘Take over, do everything,’ you’re not doing nothing.”</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Richest Comedian In The World: An Inside Look At Jerry Seinfeld's $950 Million</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS2tb%2BMp6atZZGXvLbAjK2fnmWdpLumxYyknK%2BhnmK1or7TZpyxqJyWtq%2B%2FjLCfsmWYmnq4rc2tqmaZXZe2rbjIqKWaoaKaeqPFjJqenmVkanw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-penny-davidi-married-her-bio-age-husband-and-net-worth-561469-html.html><span>←</span><span>Is Penny Davidi Married?
