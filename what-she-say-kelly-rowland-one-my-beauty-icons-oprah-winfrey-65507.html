I love that fact that she’s so comfortable with herself. One of my favorite episodes of her show was when she showed millions of people how she woke up in the morning with no makeup on. That was so selfless and revealing. She’s very real and genuine and I love that. Halle Berry is one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen. Same thing with Whitney Houston and Janet Jackson — especially as a kid, because they have brown skin like me.

Inside and out, she seems as real and as genuine as the Halle Berry’s, Oprah Winfrey’s and Janet Jackson’s of the world. With her no. 1 hit “Motivation” climbing the charts, her newly appointed position as a judge on X-Factor and looking flawless almost at every glance, is it safe to say that Miss Kelly is about to start commanding the attention of the U.S. like no other?</span></p><p><span>We think so.<br></span></p><p><span><a href=# rel=nofollow>Source</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6y1osCMrJ%2BeZaOWxm63xKWjsmWipMStrc2dZKimlWK6unnBnpiurKlitqS7zaxkqKiilrVuw8innaudqWKDdoGPcGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-has-sarah-hyland-been-up-to-since-the-end-of-modern-family.html><span>←</span><span>What Has Sarah Hyland Been Up To Since The End Of Modern Family?</span></a>
