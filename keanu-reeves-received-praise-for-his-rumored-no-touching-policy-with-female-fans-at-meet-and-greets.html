Many of them have varying degrees of comfort when interacting with their fans. Some celebrities are fairly close to their fans, while others prefer to keep their distance.</p><p>While some might be quick to judge those who keep their distance, it's not difficult to understand why when one sees <a href=#>how many stars are targeted by obsessive stalkers</a>.</p><p>However, for <a href=#><strong>Keanu Reeves</strong></a>, his method of keeping a safe distance from his fans actually earned him praise. Fans online noticed the actor never touched his female fans when posing for pictures together. Reeves is even rumored to have a "no touching" policy.</p><h2 id=social-media-praised-keanu-reeves-for-his-rumored-39-no-touching-39-policy-when-posing-with-female-fans>Social Media Praised Keanu Reeves For His Rumored 'No Touching' Policy When Posing With Female Fans</h2><p>In 2019, the #MeToo movement was in full swing. Women who have been taken advantage of by high-profile, powerful men were speaking out about the harassment and assaults they've experienced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This resulted in multiple famous men being accused of harassment and assault. It was during this time that Keanu Reeves went viral on social media when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter user Kemoy Lindsay noticed the actor never touched the backs of the women he poses with in pictures</a>.</p><p>Lindsay seemed to suggest Reeves was trying to avoid being the next male celebrity to be accused, writing, "Lol Keanu ain’t taking no chances."</p><p>Lindsay's post featured photos of Reeves posing with several female fans as well as singer Dolly Parton. Reeves' alleged "no touching" policy when meeting fans earned the actor praise on social media.</p><p>"I stan a respectful king love you so much Keanu," one fan wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another fan responded to Lindsay's suggestion and said it was just Reeves trying to be respectful.</p><p>"It’s not about not taking chances," the user wrote. "It’s about being considerate and respectful, qualities that Keanu carries in spades."</p><p>Another user agreed, writing, "He’s respectful. This should be how it’s done unless ya know the woman doesn’t mind being touched. Keanu should inspire us all."</p><p>However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not everyone thought Reeves' actions were a reflection of something positive</a>.</p><p>"This isn’t normal lol. The people who say ‘he’s being respectful’ are applauding a culture of fear as opposed to one of affection," one user wrote. "He’s doing this out of fear, not a sense of respect. There is nothing disrespectful about a hug in the first place."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/keanu-reeves-got-pessimistic-about-his-love-life-while-telling-jay-leno-about-celebrating-his-39th-birthday-alone.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title='Jay Leno Served As Keanu Reeves&#39; Therapist During His "Mortality" And "Love Life" Rants'>Jay Leno Served As Keanu Reeves' Therapist During His "Mortality" And "Love Life" Rants</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Despite aging well at 59, Keanu Reeves wasn't so optimistic about turning 39 in 2003. He was almost sure his love life would be "awful" in his 40s.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a CBS News article</a>, "hover hands" is a sign of good manners in South Korea. Some users believed Reeves was following an etiquette rule that is very common in the country. The article also stated that Reeves might be following his mother's practice of being polite. Reeves revealed in a 2011 BBC interview that his mother raised him with good manners.</p><h2 id=avril-lavinge-however-was-widely-criticized-for-keeping-her-distance-from-fans-at-a-meet-and-greet-in-brazil>Avril Lavinge, However, Was Widely Criticized For Keeping Her Distance From Fans At A Meet And Greet In Brazil</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar53424484.jpg><p>In May 2014, Avril Lavigne went viral on social media when pictures from a meet and greet in Brazil showed her standing very far from fans. It got even more attention when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was revealed that the fans spent around $400 to meet Lavigne and get a picture with her</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were rumors Lavigne imposed a "no touching" rule, which she later explained.</p><p>"I do touch my fans," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lavigne told KiSS 92.5 in Canada</a>. "My fans are very frisky, actually. In some countries where we've had security breaches, it's a little delicate because of things that have happened with stuff I probably shouldn't get into."</p><p>Lavigne wasn't kidding, either. In 2011, a fan in Brazil stormed the stage during her concert tour stop in the country. This is most likely the reason fans were standing so far away from Lavigne in the pictures.</p><p>Whether intentional or not, Lavigne developed a reputation as someone who keeps their distance from fans. This was proven when, in 2015, Taylor Swift allegedly liked a Tumblr post comparing how she treats her fans with other stars.</p><p>The meme featured pictures of Lavigne, Kanye West, Britney Spears, and Katy Perry. While they all seemed distant or disinterested in their fans, Swift was shown to be very affectionate towards her own fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/avril-lavigne-explained-her-relationship-with-her-fans-after-awkward-photos-from-a-meet-and-greet-went-viral-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Avril Lavigne's Awkward Meet And Greet Photos, Explained">Avril Lavigne's Awkward Meet And Greet Photos, Explained</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Avril Lavigne later explained there was a good reason fans were asked to keep their distance during a meet and greet.</p><p>This was picked up by people on Twitter and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lavigne felt the need to comment on the comparison</a>.</p><p>"Comparison is judging and judging a person does not define who they are it defines who you are," Lavigne wrote.

The only problem is that Seinfeld didn't want to give her a hug.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pop star and comedian were both at a charity event when they crossed paths on the red carpet. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When Kesha asked Seinfeld for a hug</a>, he said "No thanks." When the singer asked a second time, he repeated himself, "No thanks."</p><p>Kesha then walked away disappointed and possibly embarrassed. Seinfeld asked the reporter who that was. When he is informed that it was Kesha, he said, "Okay, well I wish her the best."</p><p>The awkward encounter went viral and many were curious as to the motive behind Seinfeld's refusal. He later cleared things up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when speaking to Extra</a>.</p><p>"I'm 63, I don't know every pop star… I don't know everyone," he said, revealing that he's just not the hugging type. "I'm not, well as a total stranger." When the host, A. J. Calloway, asked him why he got a hug, Seinfeld said, "But I know you how many years? I've known you twenty years."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seinfeld then said that he was "flattered" by Kesha being a fan of his.
