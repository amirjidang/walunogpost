The same is true for the rest of <a href=#>the excellent cast of the series</a>. So, it's only natural to want to compare the stars of the show and see<a href=#> how much each of them has made</a> before, during, and after the acclaimed YA mystery drama. There's no doubt that <a href=#>Ashley Benson and Shay Mitchell</a> have continuously made more due to being cast in various popular projects since Pretty Little Liars. But how much has Lucy made?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Lucy hasn't been in the spotlight the same way her former co-star Shay Mitchell has. There's no doubt that she's made a lot of money. Not only is she the face of several major brands, but she's had a pretty illustrious career. Here's how much Lucy is worth and what exactly she spends her money on...</p><h2 id=how-lucy-made-her-6-million-net-worth>How Lucy Made Her $6 Million Net Worth</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Lucy Hale is worth $6 million. Of course, much of that impressive number comes from her time on Pretty Little Liars. She reportedly made about $42,000 per episode at the height of the show's popularity. With 20 episodes per season, Lucy was making roughly $840,000 per year in the later seasons of the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Stylecaster</a>. As for her brief stint on The CW's Katy Keene, which came shortly after Pretty Little Liars ended, Stylecaster believes she earned about $45,000 per episode. This is based on the fact that the leading actors of Riverdale, who were all virtually unknown, make between $40 and $50,0000 per episode. However, Riverdale has become a massive earner for The CW. So, while Lucy's team probably negotiated a higher wage for her after the success of Pretty Little Liars, it may not have been that much. Addionally, Katy Keene was canceled after low ratings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why The Creators Of 'Pretty Little Liars' Claim Their Show Isn't 'Gossip Girl'</a></span></p><p>Lucy has also contributed to her net worth with other major projects throughout her career including a role in Scream 4, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2, How I Met Your Mother, The O.C., and a number of acclaimed independent films. On top of this, she has also been modeling for various brands since she was young. A quick look at her Instagram shows that she has several major endorsement deals including with Honeynut Cheerios and Hunkemoller Lingerie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lucy, who also has a bit of a music career to help her net worth, is continuing with her journey of becoming an A-list television star with her upcoming series Ragdoll on AMC. She also has four more movies in the works including Big Gold Brick with Oscar Isaac and Megan Fox.</p><h2 id=lucy-hale-said-she-wasn-39-t-a-car-snob-until-she-became-rich>Lucy Hale Said She Wasn't A Car Snob Until She Became Rich</h2><p>According to People, Lucy Hale has not become a car snob with her success in Hollywood. At least, that's what Lucy said in 2010 when she still owned a Prius. Over the years, her bank account has grown substantially and so has her interest in expensive vehicles. To be fair, in her 2010 interview with People, she did say that her interest in cars could change.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Tragic Truth About ‘Pretty Little Liars’ Star Sasha Pieterse’s Health Issues</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I definitely love that all these car brands are coming out with hybrid forms of every car that they have. It’s very awesome because I think it does make a difference, and it doesn’t hurt that you save a lot of money on gas," Lucy explained to People. "I love Range Rovers, so maybe one day [I’ll drive one] as the complete opposite of a Prius."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just recently, in 2021, Lucy was spotted fueling up her massive Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon at a Shell gas station in Culver City, California. The gigantic black car may be fuel-efficient in comparison to earlier models, but it's certainly no Prius. Additionally, Lucy was spotted with a black G-Wagon in 2021 and a white one back in 2019,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> according to The Daily Mail</a>. So, her interest in cars has certainly changed with her increased bank account. Speaking of which, a brand new Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon costs roughly $154,900. So, even if she purchased a used car or leased it, she absolutely forked over a pile of dough for it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Every Guy Lucy Hale Was Connected To Before Skeet Ulrich</a></span></p><p>We know what Lucy drives, but what about where she lives?</p><p>The most revealing information about Lucy Hale's interest in properties came in 2019 when she listed her Studio City, California house for $2.4 million and purchased one a few blocks away for $2.9 around the same time. The one she purchased is a stunning Spanish-style home built in the 1940s. It has a pool, a long winding driveway that's gated off, chestnut wood floors, and 4 bedrooms, according to The Baltimore Sun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-is-what-lucy-spends-most-of-her-money-on>This Is What Lucy Spends Most Of Her Money On</h2><p>To anyone into fashion and make-up as much as the gorgeous Lucy Hale is, it should come as no surprise that skincare is where she reportedly spends the majority of her money.</p><p>"I definitely invest in my skincare. That’s one thing that my whole bank account goes to. You name it, my facialist, products, all of it. It’s my favorite thing…it makes me feel really good," she told CNBC in 2019. "I have probably thousands of products, like not going to lie."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the same interview, Lucy said that she doesn't feel bad spending money if she's worked hard for it. She also added that it's necessary to give back. Among the many charities that she supports is Smile Train, a non-profit helping kids who are born with cleft palates. She's also done work with The Voice of Meningitis and Black Lives Matter.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Real Reason Fans Hated The 'Pretty Little Liars' Finale</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6rcHCsmShmZyawG66xK1ksKeiqbVurc2dZKGnp2LAqbGMrKeeppSoeqrAjGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-ann-green-heard-paige-and-craig-cheating-rumors-at-bravocon.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Ann Green Heard Paige and Craig Cheating Rumors at BravoCon</span></a>
