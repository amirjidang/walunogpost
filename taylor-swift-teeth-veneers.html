Many have sought the help of a specialist orthodontist. Superstars like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift</a> have had traditional braces or Invisalign to get their smiles ready for the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the biggest musical acts in pop history</a>. Since her eighth studio album called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Folklore</a>, fans notice <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">every detail about her</a>, including her physical appearance.</p><h2 id=braces>Braces</h2><p>The singer had braces as a teenager according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celeb Answers</a>. Years later, she used retainers because teeth still get more crooked with age. The good thing about retainers is that you only need to wear them at night, which was perfect for Taylor's busy schedule in front of the cameras.</p><p>It is not clear when exactly her teeth transformation occurred. However, fans suspected a smile makeover when she made her debut in the music scene with perfectly straight white teeth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Joe Alwyn And Taylor Swift Met</a></span></p><p>Taylor used to forget her retainers in hotel rooms. In a video from 2011, the artist recorded one of her visits to the dentist. She promised to be more careful and not lose them again.</p><h2 id=dental-surgery>Dental Surgery</h2><p>Taylor chipped her tooth during a live show in Pittsburgh after "uppercutting" herself in the mouth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a> about the accident at that time, the artist joked, "I try to be really quick with the microphone […] so I really quickly pulled my mic up to sing, and basically uppercut punched myself in the tooth."</p><p>She even admitted that she saw her tooth fall onto the stage and felt very worried about the damage's gravity. In any case, Taylor continued the show with a lot of energy and a great performance.</p><h2 id=teeth-whitening>Teeth Whitening</h2><p>Taylor is also known for having a gorgeous smile. Her dentist just took her beauty that she already has over the edge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tooth bleaching is the quickest way to get a full smile makeover. Dull, stained teeth are then transformed, leaving patients with a bright smile that looks brand-new. It is well-known in Hollywood that white smiles are a sign of youth and can brighten up a person's entire complexion resulting in less apparent wrinkles and a fresher younger appearance according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coburg Hill Oral Care</a> dental clinic.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Sebastian Stan Felt About His ‘MCU’ Co-Star Dating Taylor Swift</a></span></p><p>Fans think that Taylor Swift had to get her teeth fixed because she has overcome some serious dental issues due to puberty or accidents during shows. The reason why she has kept these procedures as a secret is probably because she is highly exposed to cyberbullying. Also, haters take advantage of her looks to make fun of her, so Taylor's publicist needs to take care of her image.</p><p>Swifties –how her fans called themselves- are the biggest inspiration and support for the singer. While Taylor can rely on them, she knows that what really matters, it's what's inside. Because of her work and the constant pressure to meet celebrities' high standards, she needs to make sure that her appearance keeps appealing to the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift remains a complicated figure. Beloved by many but continuously scrutinized. Still, one way or another, people are always talking about her, and that's because her fingerprints are all over the 2010s. Taylor defined some of the decade's most significant musical and cultural trends and became the millennial generation's voice.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande & 9 More Musicians Who Earned The Most In 2019</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lpJqytbSMr5ynnZWnwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hbo-max-discovery-become-max-what-does-that-mean-your-subscriptions.html><span>←</span><span>HBO Max, Discovery+ become Max, what does that mean for your subscriptions?
