On Wednesday (July 27), the Grammy Award-winning singer finally unveiled the differences between four box sets that were presented to fans back in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>June</a> by name only.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On Beyoncé’s official website, customers were given the option to select from poses one through four, without knowing any details—only that each would be on a different t-shirt. But now, the mystery is no more.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Each pose features Beyoncé poised on the silver-glowing horse from her album cover. She shifts her facial expression, as well as the position of her arms and hands in each different look.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The now, not-so-mysterious boxes also come with a physical CD, a 28-page photo booklet, and a mini-poster. Beyond the pose reveal, Beyoncé has decided to keep fewer secrets this album release, as opposed to her game-shifting surprise drops: her 2013 self-titled album, and the acclaimed Lemonade in 2016.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Earlier this week, the tracklist and production credits for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Renaissance</a> were revealed, highlighting intriguing song titles and potential collaborators. The credits include Drake, Tems, Pharrell, Mike Dean, Nova Wav, Honey Dijon, Syd, Jay-Z, Solange, and more.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The tracklist also came with the acapella and instrumental versions of the album’s lead single “Break My Soul,” which made <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Billboard Hot 100</a> history earlier this month.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch the official lyric video for “Break My Soul” below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5eyurvNnJxmqpWjrqq%2F0pqlnJ1dl7y5edKeq2aon6iytHmQa2ptbmhmg3mCjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amanda-schmitt-grazioli-was-murdered-by-husband-john-grazioli-what-happened-to-him-and-where-is-he-now-226509-html.html><span>←</span><span>Amanda Schmitt Grazioli Was Murdered By Husband John Grazioli- What Happened To Him And Where Is He</span></a>
