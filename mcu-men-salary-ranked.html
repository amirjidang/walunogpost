A number of franchises have reached this milestone, but it feels like the films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe largely made this possible. Marvel movies have become the new normal, not just in terms of blockbusters, but also the talent that they attract. Most of the biggest actors in America have some role in the MCU.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These movies have accomplished a lot, but they're also instrumental ways for these actors to become even bigger. Now a Marvel movie can be an easy paycheck, but it's important to not lose sight of how far some of these actors have grown within the MCU and what a difference it's made for their pay. More MCU salary goodness, here.</p><h2 id=clark-gregg-s-coulson-clears-in-75-000-an-episode><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Clark Gregg's Coulson Clears In $75,000 An Episode</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Clark-Gregg-Agent-Coulson-Poster.jpg><p>Clark Gregg wasn't exactly an unknown when the MCU was first getting rolling, but it's fair to see that Agent Coulson is definitely his favorite character. Gregg is a solid, reliable presence in the MCU and even death hasn't held back Coulson from making more appearances. Gregg has become more reputable with each new film, which has helped his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">salary slowly increase</a> over the years. He banks $75,000 for an episode of Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., which totals to more than $1 million a season and leads to his $10 million net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paul-rudd-s-marvel-salary-it-set-to-expand-and-grow-1-5-million><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Paul Rudd's Marvel Salary It Set To Expand And Grow ($1.5 Million)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Paul-Rudd-Ant-Man.jpg><p>Paul Rudd is another sublime piece of Marvel casting and even though he entered the MCU a little later than others, Ant-Man has become an integral part of the universe. Paul Rudd was paid quite low ($300,000) during the first Ant-Man, and while firm numbers of his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Endgame salary</a> aren't available, he's making a little more and learning the importance of taking advantage of back-end profits from his films.</p><h2 id=tom-holland-s-spider-man-swings-in-at-around-3-million><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Tom Holland's Spider-Man Swings In At Around $3 Million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tom-Holland-Spider-Man-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spider-Man has had a very tumultuous life in the cinema, with the superhero's story going through several reboots before he nicely found a place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Audiences have praised Tom Holland's earnest interpretation of Peter Parker. Holland's paycheck for Spider-Man: Homecoming was just $500,000, but his star has only risen within the MCU, earning <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">around $3 million</a> for Endgame, and he's built up a net worth of $4 million.</p><h2 id=chadwick-boseman-honors-wakanda-at-2-3-million><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Chadwick Boseman Honors Wakanda At $2-3 Million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chadwick-Boseman-Black-Panther-Wakanda-Forever.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe found unprecedented success with Black Panther and the films pushed the character into the mainstream in a really big way. Part of the reason that Black Panther's character connects so well is because of Chadwick Boseman's layered performance. Boseman may have only received $2 million for Black Panther, but its success earned him <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">slightly more</a> for Infinity War, and he's got a net worth of $5 million.</p><h2 id=chris-pratt-s-star-lord-flies-in-at-5-million><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Chris Pratt's Star Lord Flies In At $5 Million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chris-Pratt-Star-Lord-Guns-Drawn.jpg><p>It's hard to believe that there was a time before Chris Pratt was a blockbuster magnet and leading the pack in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. The comedic actor has made a stunning transition and while he entered the MCU at a cheaper price, his cost has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">absolutely increased</a> as more franchises become anchored around him. Now he's at a point where it might actually be difficult to get him to appear in a sitcom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=josh-brolin-s-big-villain-is-well-paid-5-6-million><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Josh Brolin's Big Villain Is Well Paid ($5-6 Million)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Josh-Brolin-Thanos-Destruction.jpg><p>The 20 films that comprise the first three phases of the Marvel Cinematic Universe are an incredible achievement. They pull off a feat that's arguably never been done before and for over a decade these movies were teasing a big showdown against Thanos the Mad Titan. The threat of Thanos looms for many films, but Infinity War and Endgame are his real showpieces. Marvel wanted a notable star as their major villain and Josh Brolin earned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">between $5-$6 million</a> for his villainous work in Infinity War.</p><h2 id=samuel-l-jackson-gets-the-big-bucks-for-forming-the-team-6-million><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Samuel L Jackson Gets The Big Bucks For Forming The Team ($6 Million)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Samuel-L-Jackson-Nick-Fury.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's unlikely that Sam Jackson's Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. is going to get his own solo film, but he was very much the connective tissue for Phase One of the MCU. Jackson's presence is typically more of a supporting player, but he's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very well compensated</a> and he doesn't appear to be leaving the universe anytime soon.</p><h2 id=tom-hiddleston-s-loki-is-a-villain-who-demands-respect-8-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Tom Hiddleston's Loki Is A Villain Who Demands Respect ($8 Million)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tom-Hiddleston-Loki-Thor-Ragnarok.jpg><p>Strong villains have always been a big issue within the MCU, so the effectiveness of Tom Hiddleston's Loki stands out even more as a result. Loki has slowly grown into a fan favorite character and even has his own TV show on the way. Hiddleston earned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">around $8 million</a> for Infinity War, which is kind of insane considering the mere minutes that he's in the film. This comes a long ways from the first Avengers, where he only made $800,000 and was the major villain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anthony-hopkins-odin-has-earned-a-fortune-10-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Anthony Hopkins' Odin Has Earned A Fortune ($10 Million)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Anthony-Hopkins-Odin.jpg><p>Anthony Hopkins is one of the more acclaimed actors to join the MCU and he brings a level of sophistication and experience that's not there with the fresher crop of stars. Hopkins makes for a perfect Odin, even if it seems like he doesn't always understand his dialogue. Hopkins isn't as acclaimed as he was during his prime, but his long history in the field has led to him earning big bucks for his Marvel work, even if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$10 million</a> is still a cut from his typical rate.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Actors Who Turned Down MCU Roles</a></span></p><h2 id=chris-hemsworth-has-earned-a-lot-as-the-god-of-thunder-15-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Chris Hemsworth Has Earned A Lot As The God Of Thunder ($15 Million)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chris-Hemsworth-Thor-Hammer.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It took awhile for Thor to catch on in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Chris Hemsworth's magnetic performance has never been the issue. Thor has arguably never been more popular after Taika Waititi's&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;with&nbsp;Thor: Love and Thunder on the way. Like the rest of the core Avengers, Hemsworth's Endgame salary rested at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$15 Million</a>, but he brought in over double that when he led the show in Ragnarok.</p><h2 id=benedict-cumberbatch-s-sorcerer-supreme-isn-t-cheap-under-15-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Benedict Cumberbatch's Sorcerer Supreme Isn't Cheap (Under $15 Million)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Benedict-Cumberbatch-Dr-Strange-Magic.jpg><p>Benedict Cumberbatch is yet another impeccable piece of Marvel casting for the role of Dr. Stephen Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme. Cumberbatch was very popular when Marvel managed to sign him for nearly $6.5 million in the original Dr. Strange. With a sequel on the way, Cumberbatch's worth had only increased. It's said that for Endgame, Cumberbatch got a big pay boost, bringing in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">just under $15 million</a>, what Scarlett Johansson and the other main Avengers made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jeremy-renner-s-hawkeye-hits-the-target-at-15-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye Hits The Target At $15 Million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jeremy-Renner-Hawkeye-Falling.jpg><p>Hawkeye is a bit of an outsider within the Marvel Cinematic Universe and even though he's an important part of the Avengers, he's never been given a solo film to flesh the character out. Hawkeye may often feel like an afterthought in the Marvel films, but it was a big deal when the MCU snagged Renner and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his pay</a> has reflected that. He was hot off an Academy Award nomination and very hot, even if he's since cooled off a little.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranking Our 20 Favorite MCU Characters By Who We'd Want To Be</a></span></p><h2 id=mark-ruffalo-s-hulk-transformation-has-paid-off-15-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Mark Ruffalo's Hulk Transformation Has Paid Off ($15 Million)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mark-Ruffalo-Professor-Hulk.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mark Ruffalo has done an incredible job tapping into the extreme duality of Bruce Banner and the Hulk. Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Endgame helped push the character to exciting new places. Ruffalo may not have a solo film as the Hulk under his belt, but he's far from underappreciated. Ruffalo's payday for his last Avengers film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accrued him $15 million</a>, much like the other Avengers in the movie.</p><h2 id=chris-evans-has-earned-a-lot-to-don-the-shield-15-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Chris Evans Has Earned A Lot To Don The Shield ($15 Million)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chris-Evans-Captain-America-Running.jpg><p>Few actors embody their cinematic alter egos better than Chris Evans' turn as Steve Rogers' Captain America.

Groot is a real highlight of the cosmic Guardians of the Galaxy and a nice change of pace for the action star.

Downey Jr. is Tony Stark as far as most people are concerned, but he was hardly the A-lister that he is now when he first started his superhero gig. Downey Jr.'s importance to the MCU has repeatedly been underscored and he's ended up receiving a huge salary to keep Iron Man in the picture, garnering <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">at least $50 million</a> for his final Avengers film– but some expect it was considerably higher, as well as receiving a handsome piece of the film’s back-end profits.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Marvel Characters The MCU Completely Ruined</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknK1dorKvedKao5qqqWK%2ForrKnpto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1245101-todd-pettingill-owen-hart.html><span>←</span><span>Todd Pettengill On Owen Hart Being Apologetic To Him After King Of The Ring 1994</span></a>
