The musical collective, which consisted of Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone and Lance Bass, rose to fame thanks to their self-titled debut album. Singles like I Want You Back,Bye Bye Bye,It's Gonna Be Me, Girlfriend, and others propelled the boy band's name as one of the most important cornerstones of pop culture.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>NSYNC Finally Admitted They Haven't Reunited Because Of Justin Timberlake</a></span></p><p>However, those glory days are long gone. The boys <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded their one last tune as a collective back in 2002</a> before going into an indefinite state of hiatus. Since then, they each have embarked on their own respective solo careers, albeit reuniting for several special occasions. To celebrate their impressive career, here's a look back at the members of NSYNC, what they're up to now, and a definitive ranking based on their net worth, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Update September 2023:</strong> Since NSYNC went on hiatus, each of the individual members has remained busy both with their personal and professional lives.</p><p>Most recently, it was announced that Justin Timberlake will be releasing his latest album, a FutureSex/LoveSounds 2.0 of sorts at the top of 2024. He is also waiting for his latest film, Reptile to be released. But with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike, there is no telling when that will be.</p><p>Lance Bass is remaining busy as the father of twins and the host of the successful podcast, Frosted Tips. All the business ventures that Bass has been involved with over the years <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">helped him make his fortune</a>, as NSYNC made him and the rest of the group household names but not rich.</p><p>JC Chasez has been busy working on shopping around two musicals that he wrote. He also partnered with Meow Mix for a cat food campaign that is keeping his name fresh in the minds of business executives and hopefully opens the door for other opportunities Chasez wants to explore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joey Fatone has not only had to learn how to navigate through a divorce and co-parenting but deciding what he wants his career to look like moving forward. And for him, that is potentially doing more work behind the camera.</p><p>Chris Kirkpatrick is best known for hitting the 90s Con and Pop Paradise 2000 circuits. The stories that he tells with members of other boy bands are not only entertaining but nostalgic for both Kirkpatrick and the audience alike.</p><h2 id=justin-timberlake-39-s-net-worth-is-250-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Justin Timberlake's Net Worth Is $250 Million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/justin-timberlake.jpg><p>Justin Timberlake is undoubtedly the most successful member of NSYNC. After the group, he went on to make his mark as a solo artist and became one of the best-selling musicians of all time with ten Grammy Awards under his belt. This helped him to build his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fortune of $250 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also went off to pursue an acting career and most recently finished Grant Singer's feature-film directorial debut in the crime thriller Reptile.</p><p>The father of two boys, whom Timberlake shares with Jessica Biel chooses to be very hands-on with his kids. But with both his acting and singing career and Biel's acting and producing career, the two feel fortunate that they are able to rely on their nannies to help raise their boys as far out of the spotlight as possible.</p><h2 id=lance-bass-39-net-worth-is-20-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lance Bass' Net Worth Is $20 Million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lance-bass-looking-uncomfortable.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to his singing career, Lance Bass has a few lucrative business lines under his name.

A certified cosmonaut, he planned to join the TMA-1 mission to the International Space Station before his financial sponsors backed out back in the years. Though with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $20 million</a>, he may have been able to pay for his portion of the trip himself.</p><p>The wealth and the glam of Hollywood don't seem to phase the crooner.

He notably provided his distinctive singing voice for pop star Chip Skylark on Nickelodeon's The Fairly OddParents and competed in some of the most exciting game shows, like Gone Country on CMT in 2008 and his recent endeavor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Big Brother, in February 2022.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think I'm least looking forward to not seeing my family or having that connection with the outside world that I usually have," the boy band legend told EW about his recent endeavor with Big Brother.

He put his feet to the test in 2007 by coming in second place on ABC's Dancing with the Stars. An avid fan of cooking, he also hosted Food Network's Rewrapped and My Family Recipe Rocks on Live Well Network. As such it is no wonder he is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth a cool $7 million.</a></p><p>Recently, he announced his new line of calzones at Schlotzsky's sandwich and pizza franchise. This doesn't mean he has stopped singing though, as he tied with Rumer Willis on season one of The Masked Singer in 2019. While Fatone has done some smaller-scale directorial work, he has said that his next project will be a documentary. What the details of that documentary are, have yet to be revealed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">But what about an NSYNC reunion?</a> Is that in the cards?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"As far as NSYNC is concerned, never say never, but I know right now that nothing's happening," Fatone explained.

Justin's been out writing and producing."</p><p>Perhaps one day the group will come back together.
