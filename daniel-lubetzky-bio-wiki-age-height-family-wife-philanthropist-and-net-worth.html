KIND has since become the fastest-growing snack company in the United States.</p><p>In 2018, Daniel founded a New York-based family office known as Equilibra, which supports entrepreneur-run businesses that offer packaged goods to consumers, investments include Greek yogurt brand Ellenos as well as social enterprise Yellow Leaf Hammocks. He has featured as a guest shark in episodes of Shark Tank in seasons 11 and 12.
