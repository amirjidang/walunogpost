It's been five months since the actor took a break from social media, and while he didn't delete his accounts or his previous posts, he wasn't posting anything either.

Swifties are convinced it will dive into both the relationship and the breakup, and with all these theories flying around, fans can't help wonder if Joe's sudden return to public life means something.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-alwyn-returned-to-instagram-after-a-long-break>Joe Alwyn Returned To Instagram After A Long Break</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/joe-alwyn.jpg><p>Joe Alwyn's return to social media came as something of a surprise. <strong>The actor has always been known for being private, and after his breakup with Taylor Swift, he took protecting his privacy all the more seriously</strong>.</p><p>People all over the world were demanding answers about how, when, and why the relationship had ended, and save for a few comments from select sources, Joe Alwyn has remained completely quiet about the whole thing.</p><p>He also hasn't been spotted on any big projects in a while, and <strong>his return to public life, at least for a bit, has also led to speculation about whether he's got something up his sleeve</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The new post, which, like the rest of his Instagram, has the comments turned off, was a simple photo dump of what seem to be old memories. The whole post has a very nostalgic vibe</strong>, and the slides include a photo of his dog, black and white pictures of himself in important moments of his career, childhood pictures, landscapes, and a still of Ricky Gervais in The Office (UK) where he says "Different drinks for different needs".</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-upcoming-album>Taylor Swift's Upcoming Album</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joe Alwyn's return to social media comes at a point where his past relationship with Taylor Swift is once again being put under the spotlight. <strong>Although Taylor is very famously dating Travis Kelce, it hasn't been that long since her and Joe's breakup, and swifties still wonder what went wrong in their six-year relationship</strong>.</p><p>When, during her acceptance speech at the Grammys, Taylor Swift announced the imminent release of her new album, The Tortured Poets Department, theories started going around about what the record would be about.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/joe-alwyn-and-taylor-swift.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Joe Alwyn Is Reportedly Spiralling As He Worries What Taylor Swift’s New Album Will Reveal">Joe Alwyn Is Reportedly Spiralling As He Worries What Taylor Swift’s New Album Will Reveal</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Fans are already theorizing that the album's title is a direct reference to Taylor's ex-boyfriend.</p><p><strong>The singer revealed during the announcement that she had been working on this new album for two years and was finally ready to show it to the world</strong>, and fans took that to mean two things.</p><p><strong>One, the album would dive into the final moments of the relationship.

That was almost four years ago.</p><p>Also, when Taylor Swift released the track list for the new album, <a href=#>swifties couldn't help but find alleged references to Joe Alwyn</a>. <strong>So, maybe Joe's return to social media has something to do with him wanting to share his side of the story when the album finally comes out</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ1dlrm4xc1mpJqjlah6r7vSrZiln5mYerG0zq2mZpylor1urcyim2asmJq8s7XErGStmamhvLN50rCgn6xdo7K4ecClma6lXZavsMHTZp%2BipV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joe-alwyn-reportedly-spiralling-worries-what-taylor-swifts-album-reveal.html><span>←</span><span>Joe Alwyn Is Reportedly Spiralling As He Worries What Taylor Swifts New Album Will Reveal</span></a>
