However, just because the general public ignores a celebrity relationship ending, doesn’t mean the situation is any less traumatic for the people involved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Forgotten Celebrity Couples Broke Up Exactly 10 Years Ago</a></span></p><p>Over the years, there have been several <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrities whose divorces were incredibly costly</a>. In most of those cases, there have been a lot of headlines about how expensive those divorces turned out to be. Interestingly enough, however, when Geena Davis got divorced in recent years, the press largely ignored the situation. As a result, most people have no idea that according to a report, Davis’ divorce settlement was downright cruel to her longtime partner.</p><h2 id=geena-davis-has-been-divorced-four-times>Geena Davis Has Been Divorced Four Times</h2><p>As a result of Geena Davis’ time as a major movie star, millions of people have seen her play characters who found love on the big screen. As it turns out, in Davis’ personal life, she clearly wants to find the right partner as well. After all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Davis has been married multiple times</a>. Sadly, however, just like a lot of other stars of both genders, Davis hasn’t been able to find a relationship that has lasted as of yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>I Do, I Do, I Don't: 10 Celebs With The Most Divorces In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Only a year before Geena Davis appeared in a hugely successful film for the first time, she married a man named Richard Emmolo in 1981. Sadly, Davis’ first marriage ended in 1984 which allowed Geena to get involved with an actor she went to star in The Fly and Earth Girls Are Easy with. On top of sharing the screen, Davis and Jeff Goldblum became a couple, got married in 1987, and then divorced in 1991. Several years after Davis’ second divorce, she married director Renny Harlin in 1993 and then they got divorced in 1998. During their marriage, Harlin directed two of Davis’ movies, Cutthroat Island and The Long Kiss Goodnight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same year Geena Davis’ third marriage ended, the Hollywood superstar got involved with Dr. Reza Jarrahy. After being together since 1998, Davis and Jarrahy’s relationship ended with their 2017 divorce. Throughout the couple’s relationship, it was believed that Davis and Jarrahy were married. However, once Davis and Jarrahy’s relationship ended, Geena claimed they were never wed, to begin with, while Reza disagreed. Whether the couple’s wedding was legal or not, they were together for almost twenty years and had kids so their relationship still ended in divorce.</p><h2 id=was-geena-davis-rsquo-divorce-cruel-to-her-common-law-husband-dr-reza-jarrahy>Was Geena Davis’ Divorce Cruel To Her Common Law Husband, Dr. Reza Jarrahy?</h2><p>As anyone who has been around kids for any period of time will be able to attest, there is one thing that children talk about all the time, whether or not things are fair. Sadly, however, once most people grow up, they no longer worry about that since they already know that life isn’t fair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Keanu Reeves Saved His Career By Turning Down This Horrible Movie</a></span></p><p>Even though it may be strange to think that things haven’t been fair for Geena Davis, that arguably is the case. After all, even though there is no doubt that Geena Davis has been very fortunate in life since she became a major movie star, it is clear Hollywood wasn’t fair to her. The reason that is the case is that a lot of stars have headlined <a href=#>movies that flopped</a> and their careers weren’t affected. However, after the movie Cutthroat Island flopped with Davis in the main role, her career never recovered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that Hollywood wasn’t fair to her, perhaps that may explain why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Geena Davis was fine with her last relationship ending in a “nasty” divorce</a>. According to a Page Six report, Davis and Dr. Reza Jarrahy’s divorce was “very unfavorable” to him because he “agreed to settle just to put this behind him and be free of the nightmare Geena has caused for him”.</p><p>When looking at Page Six’s report about Geena Davis and Dr. Reza Jarrahy’s divorce, it is important to note that they got quotes from a source close to him. Since most people feel used and abused during a divorce, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that Jarrahy reportedly is upset with how his divorce played out. However, if the source close to Jarrahy was close to accurate, the situation sounds rough for Jarrahy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Reza has had enough of her narcissism, so he was willing to take a bad deal just to make her go away and refocus on the kids. This has been devastating for Reza. Geena's priorities since day one have been to preserve her lifestyle and wealth above anything else."</p><p>"All money that could have and should have stayed in the family for their kids' futures. The legal fees drove Reza to the brink of bankruptcy. For months on end he had to sleep on friends' couches, in their spare rooms, and even in his car at times in order to keep up with payments to his lawyer. He couldn't have his kids with him while living like that, and it broke his heart … Meanwhile Geena continued to live in their Palisades mansion with the kids, oblivious to the pain she was causing her family. Her lifestyle didn't change a bit."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Does Declaring Bankruptcy Really Mean Celebrities Are Broke?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGienp2elnqlrdWiqmacmau8s6%2FEZp2rp51iwLG71KycZqqVr65utsCrqZqgqWLApK3NnZilZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-pete-arredondo-wikipedia-bio-and-personal-details-of-the-police-chief.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Pete Arredondo?
