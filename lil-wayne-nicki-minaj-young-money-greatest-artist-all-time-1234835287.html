While all three artists are among the most commercially successful rappers of all-time, Drake is the current leader of the trio in overall <a href=#>Billboard Hot 100 hits </a>and chart-topping albums.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, Nicki Minaj has broken ground and made history as a woman in Hip-Hop, as she recently became the female rapper with the most No. 1 albums after her recently released Pink Friday 2 earned the Queens native <a href=#>her third No. 1 debut </a>on the Billboard 200. In terms of overall record sales, Tunechi’s Tha Carter III album bests all of Drake and Nicki’s releases, with over eight million copies sold in the U.S.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-686510976.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj have a history of giving each other their flowers, publicly. This past June, when asked where he would rank Minaj among the greatest female rappers of all-time, the 41-year-old put Nicki at the top of the list. “I don’t wanna hurt nobody feelings but, boy, ain’t nobody f**kin’ wit’ Nicki,” Weezy told All The Smoke at the time. “They come after.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Minaj would return the favor days later while reacting to Wayne’s comments, deeming him “the greatest rapper of all-time” and voicing her gratitude for his support. “I’ll give u a dollar if you can find a lie!” she said on Instagram. “When the greatest rapper of all time believed and still believes in you. I sure did lean on your confidence and you sure were ALWAYS there. ‘Til this day, when I send you something, you send a verse back. [Lil Wayne], we love you so much. We thank you so much. Long live the BAR! Bar for Bar. No pun intended.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-697150078.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6G2rXnWmrCnnV2jtqS3yGakoqaRn3q6u9Snnmaln6OyunnGq5yarJWowW6t0a2grKxdlrmtedOipJ5lYWeAdYSSbmlxb18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leah-brancato-missing-norway-ct-girl-found-safe-sound.html><span>←</span><span>Leah Brancato Missing Norway CT Girl Found Safe &amp;amp; Sound</span></a>
