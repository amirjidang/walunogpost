In an exclusive interview with TheThings, Chase DeMoor spilled all the tea about what really happened after the cameras stopped rolling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-the-ocean-became-a-secret-hiding-place-for-off-camera-conversations>How The Ocean Became A Secret Hiding Place For Off-Camera Conversations</h2><p>Sitting down with TheThings, Chase revealed that not everything that went down was captured by the cameras, sharing, "there's a lot of stuff that you guys don't necessarily see". In fact, similar to the tactic used by the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, these hotties were quick to outsmart the crew. Case in point? Talks in the ocean.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Too Hot To Handle: Here's Where Season 2 Was Filmed</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While chatting with friends between the waves may sound simple enough, it turns out there was something far sneakier at play. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">professional footballer</a> revealed, <strong>"we found out that you couldn't wear the mics in the ocean, so any time we needed to talk about something off-camera, me and the boys, we would all go out in the ocean and have conversations with each other there."</strong> With all of Lana's rules - and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">predictions from fans after season 1 that things could only get stricter</a> - let's hope Chase hasn't nixed that tactic for future casts by spilling the beans!</p><p>Entertaining though those conversations must have been, what happened off-camera in the aftermath of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship drama</a>?</p><h2 id=chase-opens-up-about-his-breakup-from-tabitha>Chase Opens Up About His Breakup From Tabitha</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screenrant </a>reported that Chase was widely seen as the bad boy of Season 2 after breaking up with Carly, then swiftly moving on with Tabitha - but many viewers were stunned nonetheless when Tabitha turned the tables and broke up with him. As it turns out, Chase wasn't expecting the split, either. Told fans were taken aback, Chase laughed "you didn't see it coming?! Sheesh!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Where Do ‘Too Hot To Handle’ Stars Chase DeMoor & Carly Lawrence Stand Today?</a></span></p><p>Asked what was going through his mind at the time of the tough conversation, Chase explained that even though they had an amazing date (hello, dolphins swimming alongside them!) and he definitely didn't anticipate a break up, he could feel that something was "off". It definitely didn't help that right after telling him she was there to have fun, Tabitha dropped the bomb about having showered with Cam.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Chase shared that in spite of the "double whammy", the rest of the date was great, and he even ended up carrying Tabitha down the hill, both of them laughing and having a great time until the very end.</p><h2 id=did-chase-and-tabitha-get-back-together>Did Chase And Tabitha Get Back Together?</h2><p>Still, even in an amicable split, some casualties are inevitable, especially when one party has been left reeling by a blindside. That's why, after setting her down and walking off, he headed straight for production to say he wasn't feeling well and needed to lie down - <strong>"I went and laid in a private room and kind of just...sobbed. I was being sad boy!"</strong></p><p>Luckily for these two lovebirds, they managed to patch things up before filming wrapped. As Chase told TheThings, <strong>"we actually did get a green light at the very end that was not shown, unfortunately."</strong> Plus, fans got a glimpse of the two sitting together at the finale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for life after Too Hot To Handle? Unfortunately, distance got in the way of their relationship continuing, as the star-crossed lovers live on opposite sides of the world. However, that didn't stop Chase from making a romantic gesture, and he shared that he sent Tabitha an "in-depth" love letter, along with chocolate and wine, for Christmas. He also shared that even though they aren't together anymore, they "FaceTime all the time" and have a great relationship.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Too Hot To Handle: Chase DeMoor Answers Fans' Questions And Plays Would You Rather?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKddnby1edOoZKGZnpm5pnnSrZirZZOdrrSxjJ2cpqefp3qzsdWemKWrXay1osCMq5yapJyueqmtz6mcp52UYq6nwMSrZKGho2LAsbjIrWSfqp%2BierWtwaKroZlf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yuan-yuan-tan-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Yuan Yuan Tan Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
