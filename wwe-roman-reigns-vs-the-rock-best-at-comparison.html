However, the very best wrestlers are able to push their facial expressions into matches to give an extra layer of detail to get things over.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That is something that Roman Reigns does better than most, as during matches he is able to add a lot of drama without any flash moves. Instead, he can just give a glance, whether that be aggressively or through his selling, and it takes things to another level.</p><h2 id=the-rock-trash-talking><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The Rock: Trash-Talking</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Rock-promo-to-CM-Punk-Cropped.jpg><p>Trash-talking is a huge part of the wrestling business, with the back and forth that people go through on the microphone helping to sell tickets for upcoming matches. Throughout the history of the business, there are few that have done <a href=#>a better job of that than The Rock</a>, who knows how to cut into a wrestler.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>9 Clean Roman Reigns Losses You Forgot About</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Rock is golden with a microphone in his hands, and this is a skill that Roman Reigns hasn't quite mastered to this type of level.

That's something that worked perfectly for him as a character, but Roman Reigns does the complete opposite. He makes many subtle moves, particularly during promo and backstage segments that enhance the arrogance of his character.</p><p>These little moves all help to make him an exciting wrestler to watch as fans need to pay attention to everything that he does in terms of presentation. This helps to make his segments feel must-see, which is always an important thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-rock-fan-interaction><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Rock: Fan Interaction</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/The-Rock-in-WWE.jpg><p>While Roman Reigns may know how to slow things down to slowly build the attention of an audience, The Rock can command fan interaction like a rockstar at a concert.

He puts so much attention to detail from the build-up to the in-ring product itself, and that all pays off with fans investing in what he does.</p><p>His rivalry with Jey Uso is a brilliant example of that, with this being something that he still taps into to this day even though they're on the same page. Reigns' comments during matches also add to that, as he makes things an experience for the fans.</p><h2 id=the-rock-working-as-a-singles-star><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Rock: Working As A Singles Star</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Rock-WWE-Champion-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While The Rock has a history with factions as well due to his role in the Nation Of Domination, the vast majority of his career he worked alone as a top singles act.

It didn't matter whether he was a heel or a babyface, the one-liners that he could deliver were always sublime, and they'd have fans laughing hysterically.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adding comedy into the wrestling world is something that only a few people have been able to get away with at a main event level, however, that is what The Rock did magnificently.

While Roman Reigns also has to push that side of himself, his in-ring ability is at a fantastic level right now as he is firing on all cylinders.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Cringey Roman Reigns Moments We Completely Forgot About</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He has been performing at the top of his game during his most recent run, and his matches are always engaging and enjoyable to watch.

However, that is a heel gimmick, with his previous runs as a babyface proving to be nowhere near as successful.</p><p>That is where The Rock stands ahead of him as his ability to get the fans onboard of everything that he does is a skill that few people have. He is a far greater babyface than Reigns has ever been to this stage of his career, which is a credit to his own work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenrLJuvs6mmKdlopq2qLrSZq2sZaSdsm6%2BzpyiZpqVqMFurdNmmqiloJa%2Fqr%2FOp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-times-miranda-lambert-proved-she-might-not-be-over-blake-shelton.html><span>←</span><span>15 Times Miranda Lambert Proved She Might Not Be Over Blake Shelton</span></a>
