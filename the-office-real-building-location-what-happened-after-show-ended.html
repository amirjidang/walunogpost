During the show's run on television and in the years since, The Office's most dedicated fans have never seemed to tire of hearing more about <a href=#>how the show was produced</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of how much fans of The Office care about the show, podcasts about the series have become immensely popular. Most notably, The Office Deep Dive and The Office Ladies have both become highly successful.</p><p>Of course, there are several reasons why those two podcasts are popular. After all, their hosts can <a href=#>debunk fan theories</a> and talk about what it was like to film the show. After all, Jenna Fischer, Brian Baumgartner, and Angela Kinsey spent endless hours filming The Office.</p><p>Now that fans can listen to those actors talk about The Office, many of them have learned for the first time that the show wasn't filmed on a soundstage. Instead, The Office was filmed in a very real office building. Once fans learn that news, many of them are left wondering what has happened to that building since The Office finished filming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-was-the-office-filmed-in-a-real-building>Why Was The Office Filmed In A Real Building?</h2><p>For people who've never worked in the entertainment business, it can be hard to understand why any show or movie isn't filmed in real locations. After all, viewers can often feel it when media is filmed in places that are too polished, so why not produce media in real places?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Office: Every Job Title Each Main Character Had</a></span></p><p>In reality, there are a lot of reasons why shows and movies are filmed on soundstages. After all, real locations often don't have the space for the equipment needed to film major movies or TV shows. On top of that, it can be very hard to control things like nature in real locations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Office-Cast.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With that in mind, some people may wonder why The Office was filmed in a real building. What those fans may have forgotten was that The Office was supposed to feel like it was filmed for a documentary.</p><p>As series star Angela Kinsey once explained during an episode of the Office Ladies podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filming in a real building played a key role in the show feeling like a documentary</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-office-michael-scott-paper-company.jpg><p>“A lot of times on sets, they actually build the office so if they wanna film and get a certain camera angle, they can move a wall. On our show, because it was in an actual office building, you just had to work with it. And it sort of really lent itself to the documentary style that all the shots weren’t going to look pretty.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-the-building-where-the-office-was-filmed>What Happened To The Building Where The Office Was Filmed?</h2><p>In the years since The Office's finale aired for the first time, many of the show's fans have gone back to rewatch the show over and over. As a result, it is only natural for those fans to feel like they have spent hours in the Scranton Business Park.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Questions The Office Fans Are Still Asking</a></span></p><p>While The Office fans accept that the show's cast members have <a href=#>gone on to other projects</a>, the idea of something else going on in the building where the show was filmed feels wrong. Worse yet, the idea that the building looks different from the way it used to during the filming process is even more disconcerting.</p><p>With that in mind, The Office fans are likely to be very interested in learning what has happened to the building they knew as the Scranton Business Park.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unsurprisingly, the outside of the Building where The Office was filmed mostly looks the same as it used to. However, the biggest difference is the word Quixote can be seen in huge letters on the side of the building. That stands for the company that operates there, Quixote Studios.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-office-s-chandler-valley-center-studios.jpg><p>Before the building became the home of that Quixote Studios, it was previously known as Chandler Valley Center Studios and that name was on the side of the building.</p><p>On top of the huge name on the side of the building, another change that has been made can be seen on the hedges that line the fence that closes off the parking lot.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Actor Was Originally Preferred To Steve Carell For The Role Of Michael Scott In 'The Office'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the hedges, there are now two signs. The first of those signs states there is no loitering, soliciting, or trespassing. The second warns that the parking lot is for private use only and that vehicles that shouldn't be there will be towed. Unsurprisingly, people still stand outside the fence and have their photos taken in front of the building.</p><p>According to Google, Quixote Studios which is located at 13927 Saticoy Street Panorama City, CA <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">remains open for business</a> as of this writing.</p><p>In 2020, The Dirt published an article about what happened to the building where The Office was filmed. According to their report, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the building houses two soundstages and production offices</a> on the inside.</p><p>On The Office's wikipage, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the soundstages inside the building are described in greater detail</a>. While Wiki pages can't be relied on to be accurate, the description of the soundstages gives fans an idea of what is inside the building where The Office was filmed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-office-cast.jpg><p>"Designed to produce the finest commercials, sitcoms and movies, they offer two studios, one with over 20,000 square feet of space, and the other featuring over 18,000 feet of space. Both studios feature state of the art Cycloramas and 33 to 35 foot ceilings for maximum production space."</p><p>"With over 4800 Amps of power at your disposal, you will have power to spare. Maximum comfort provided while filming with 175 tons of air conditioning. The complex also features the convenience of parking for over 300 vehicles to accommodate your needs."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on all the available information, it seems like the building where The Office was filmed is still used to produce media. While that appears to have remained the same, the interior and exterior of the building have obviously gone through changes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dpLOntcKeZKudkaF6o8HIpZuippdiubCvwK2gqKZdrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnAn6ueql2otbDDjJ6lnZ2UZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./highest-paid-hollywood-actors-breaking-down-their-million-dollar-deals.html><span>←</span><span>The Highest Paid Hollywood Actors: Breaking Down Their Million Dollar Deals</span></a>
