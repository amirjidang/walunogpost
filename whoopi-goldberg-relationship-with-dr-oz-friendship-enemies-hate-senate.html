Someone with some decent medical training but with more interest in being a celebrity than a legitimate physician. With his recently announced 2022 Pennsylvania senate candidacy, more attention has been given to some of the less-than-legitimate things he's said and done on his extremely successful daytime chat show. Of course, Dr. Oz was set up for success by Oprah Winfrey and has built an incredibly impressive career for himself. This has thrown him into the mix with an assortment of major celebrities including The View host Whoopi Goldberg.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a recent segment on The View, Whoopi absolutely slammed Dr. Oz for his comments regarding his 2022 senate bid. What makes this more interesting is the fact that the two appeared to actually know each other quite well before. They have socialized together and been on each other's shows numerous times. So, what really happened between Whoopi Goldberg and Dr. Oz? How do they really feel about each other? And is there any way that the two will stay friends now that Dr. Oz is running as a Republican?</p><h2 id=whoopi-goldberg-slammed-dr-oz-39-s-politics-on-the-view>Whoopi Goldberg Slammed Dr. Oz's Politics On The View</h2><p>Even though Dr. Mehmet Oz has declared himself a "moderate Republican" akin to Arnold Schwarzenegger, he told controversial Fox News Host Sean Hannity that he is basically a <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> Republican. And this, even by Arnold Schwarzenngar's definition, is anything but a "moderate Republican". Of course, this is something that would anger Whoopi Goldberg given the fact that she's been one of the most outspoken Trump critics on television. She has <a href=#>slammed Trump's apparent endorsement of white supremacists</a>, basically every single one of his policies, and even made fun of the fact that the <a href=#>Yankees never invited him to throw the first pitch</a>. Hell, she won't even say Donald Trump's name on The View. Instead, she refers to him as "You Know Who".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, naturally, Whoopi had some words about Dr. Oz after his appearance on Sean Hannity in November 2021.</p><p>"The TV doctor, Dr. Oz, wants to be the next senator of Pennsylvania. Let me close my lips," Whoopi said with a smirk on<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the December 1st episode of The View</a>.</p><p>Whoopi went on to criticize the vote Dr. Oz was "courting" when he spoke with Sean Hannity and claimed that he too was similar to the Fox News hosts' description of his political position, an "America-first, Make America Great Again, Republican".</p><p>"What happened to him!?" Joy Behar asked Whoopi and the rest of the co-hosts on the episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whoopi Goldberg Isn’t Pleased With The New ‘Karen’ Confrontations For The Most Hilarious Reason</a></span></p><p>This is when Sunny Hostin admitted that she, Whoopi, Joy, and the rest of The View all know Dr. Oz personally. Not only has he been a guest on the show numerous times, but they have attended various functions with him.</p><p>"We've all socialized with him," Sunny said. "But I feel like he took a turn..."</p><p>"Ya think?" Whoopi said, clearly unhappy with what Dr. Oz said on Hannity.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Whoopi Goldberg's Relationship With Patrick Swayze</a></span></p><p>While Sunny claimed that Dr. Oz started to change as a person (and political) in 2020, Whoopi jumped in and stated, "He turned before that. I'm sorry."</p><p>By the tone in her voice, it was clear that Whoopi was very angry about this. But why?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=were-whoopi-goldberg-and-dr-oz-friends>Were Whoopi Goldberg And Dr. Oz Friends?</h2><p>In November 2021, Dr. Oz featured a segment on his show with various celebrities talking about health issues. First up in the compilation was an older segment with Whoopi Goldberg who he described as a "good friend." While this could have just been an anecdotal comment, it seems that Whoopi and Dr. Oz were indeed somewhat close in years previous. This would explain Whoopi's level of frustration, anger, and disappointment with Dr. Oz's comments on Hannity and his plans for his 2022 senate run.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Whoopi Goldberg's Relationship With Iconic Director Mike Nichols</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Dr. Oz's show, Whoopi even credited him with helping her quit smoking. And even Joy Behar said that "personally" Dr. Oz was "a doll". But both she and Whoopi are deeply unhappy about his political stance and how he's choosing to use his voice, especially in terms of spreading misinformation about the pandemic.</p><p>"You either get this is about other people's health. This is not about whether you like the idea of a mandate or getting a shot. That has nothing with it," Whoopi said now speaking to the camera about Dr. Oz wanting to send kids back to school during 2020 without doing the research about the risks. "If a physician can't see that. Then you're not somebody I want to vote for no matter how much I like you! I'm sorry. No matter how much I like you, you don't have the right to talk to people like this. Talking about 'elites' and who is an 'elite'. Dude, we live in a similar area. I got a yard. I told people to come and walk in the yard and I'll stay in the house. What did you do!?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, while Whoopi and Dr. Oz seemed to have some positive history together, and perhaps even a friendship, it's highly unlikely that the two will be rekindling their connection any time soon.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Whoopi Goldberg Wishes Happy 110th Birthday To Disney Animator Of ‘Sleeping Beauty’ And ‘LOTR’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaefpbZus86lm5udopx6s7HLmquip56otaq8jLCgraBdmb9uu9lmnauhlaOxtLTIqWSeppWitqa%2FjKGYrZ1dqLKvrdOeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-truth-about-hugh-jackman-and-anna-paquins-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>The Truth About Hugh Jackman And Anna Paquin's Relationship</span></a>
