He became an overnight sensation when he took on the role of werewolf Jacob<a href=#> in the Twilight series</a>. His stint as a werewolf has earned him a lot of fans and limelight but he just seems to disappear from the acting scene after appearing in the last installment of the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Lautner rose to fame as a child star. He started his acting career as child star in 2001 and became a prodigy after he was seen in the movies such as Lavagirl 3D, Sharkboy and Cheaper by the Dozen 2. He has also lent his voices to a lot of animated films. He was popularly known as the child star for his portrayal of the superhero Sharkboy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Twilight & The Spotlight: Kristen Stewart's $70 Million Success Story</a></span></p><h2 id=enjoying-the-spotlight>Enjoying The Spotlight</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Lautner is one of the biggest actors while he was doing the Twilight film franchise. He debuted in the first installment of the franchise with lead actors Pattinson and Stewart as Jacob Black. His role in the movie became more relevant in the second installment of the series, The Twilight Saga: New Moon. This has prompted his rise to fame and he made it to stardom around 2010. Not only did he increase his fame but his bank account also flourished as he was signing deals left and right. His fame continuously flourished through The Twilight Saga: Eclipse until the last installment The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn.</p><p>He became the <a href=#>ultimate heartthrob alongside Robert Pattinson</a> at the time. In 2010 he was even ranked number one on Top 5 Hollywood Abs list of the Hollywood Access. He became so famous that he was even scared to leave the house because fans might flock into him. In his recent interview, he admitted that he felt frustrated during his intense fame because the nation’s eyes seem to be glued on him and he could no longer do anything without the attention of the world. As his fame rose, his fear of the public eyes rose as well since he apparently rarely leave his house to avoid the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=frustrations-to-leave-behind-the-shadows-of-jacob-black>Frustrations To Leave Behind The Shadows Of Jacob Black</h2><p>When the Twilight era began to die down, his fame is also starting to fade. He revealed that he felt frustrated as well when he felt like the fame was taken away from him. When the <a href=#>final installment of Twilight </a>was released in 2012, it seems like Lautner was destined for a far more success in his future career. Many fans thought that he will transition into more mature roles after the series ended. However when he started auditioning for different films, he realized that the director is after his physique rather than his acting abilities. While leaving the shadows of Jacob Black, he became frustrated when he realized that every director he encounter seemed too focus on his appearance than his talent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lautner was publicly struggling to decide what the best career move is for him. While he had secured some roles on TV after Twilight, he was not able to secure a role in a major film. He became picky with roles as he wants a role that will give him the same level of publicity as the Twilight series. A decade after the last installment of Twilight was released, he is still best known as Jacob Black.</p><h2 id=continuous-failure-in-his-career>Continuous Failure In His Career</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plenty of new opportunities flocked Lautner when the Twilight series ended but he was aiming to lead yet another blockbuster movie. He then starred as Nathan Harper in the action film Abduction. He was still a teenager when he filmed the movie which makes it harder for him to take on the role. When the movie premiered, it did not receive positive reviews and the move to launch a new phase in Lautner’s career has failed. <a href=#>After a failed movie</a>, he was anticipated to star in a quality comeback film. He then starred in the 2015 film Tracers. While the movie seems entertaining for the critics, he still failed to make a good impression.</p><p>After two failed attempt to live up to his fame, he tried once more with an indie film Run The Tide. He was enthusiastic about the film stating that it is a passion project for all of the people involved. He described his role in the project as very different and would definitely make his critics proud. However that did not happen as his<a href=#> critics seemed to be disappointed</a> yet again. Luck is also not on his side as a lot of his projects were shelved including Stretch Armstrong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The downfall of his career can be mainly attributed to his poor decision making. He is picky with movies and the movies he end up picking is not something that can jumpstart his career once again. He is currently starring in the Netflix film Home Team, which hopefully can turn his life around.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:<a href=#>&nbsp;Robert Pattinson Talks About His "Gap" He Discovered For Batman Role</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Looper</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Republic World</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMOMrZiypJ%2Bneq2t1K2lnqqjYrCivsSeqWavlaPBbrDOsKWhoZyheqKy056pZqyYmnq1w8iloKCgpGLApr3UnqOsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-why-you-dont-hear-about-lindsay-lohan-anymore.html><span>←</span><span>Heres Why You Dont Hear About Lindsay Lohan Anymore</span></a>
