Not only do they negotiate the employment and endorsement contracts of players, but they also are the primary link between the players and the teams they play for. They have great influence on where athletes decide to play and in some cases have great influence on the finances of athletes. Sports agents generally receive between 4% and 10% of the athlete's playing contract, and 10% to 20% of the athlete's endorsement contract, although these figures vary between sports. The list below represents the ten most powerful agents based on the contracts they negotiated as of 2013. The contract figures were based on an article published in Forbes Magazine. All four major North American sports are represented in this list (NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB).</p><h2 id=10-dan-lozano---current-contracts-negotiated-540-78-million><strong>10.
