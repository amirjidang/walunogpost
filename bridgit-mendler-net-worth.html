But she also hasn't earned as many millions as they have, and fans want to know why.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-the-richest-disney-star>Who Is The Richest Disney Star?</h2><p>To say that any Disney star's net worth is "low" requires an explanation of what constitutes "low." For reference, consider who the richest Disney star is; Selena Gomez outgrew her mouse ears and&nbsp;has a comfortable <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spending capacity within her $75 million net worth</a>.</p><p>Other Disney stars who have gone on to bigger projects include millionaires like&nbsp;Raven-Symoné, the Jonas Brothers (Nick, Joe, and Kevin, in that order), Demi Lovato, and more. But even stars who have had a similar trajectory as Bridgit seem to have earned more than her.</p><h2 id=what-is-bridgit-mendler-s-net-worth>What Is Bridgit Mendler's Net Worth?</h2><p>Most sources suggest that Bridgit Mendler has a net worth of about $2 million. Most of her income stems from her major role on 'Good Luck Charlie,' but she also had roles on 'Wizards of Waverly Place' and other minor projects like Disney's TV movies (pre-Disney+, of course).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="What Happened To 'Good Luck Charlie' Star Leigh-Allyn Baker?" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To 'Good Luck Charlie' Star Leigh-Allyn Baker?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Comparing the figure to big names like Selena and Demi, it's a bit confusing as to why Bridgit hasn't been raking in the cash. But what it comes down to is the fact that Bridgit stopped short of the types of opportunities that her fellow Disney alumni embraced.</p><p>For reference,&nbsp;other Disney stars with similar resumes don't outrank Bridgit's net worth by much, if at all. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Skai Jackson has a net worth of around one million dollars</a>, while Dove Cameron peaked at about $4 million, even with the 'Descendants' franchise to her name.</p><h2 id=why-is-bridgit-mendler-s-net-worth-so-low>Why Is Bridgit Mendler's Net Worth So Low?</h2><p>Though Bridgit did dabble in a record deal, thanks in part to her role in 'Lemonade Mouth,' she never quite took off the same way that her fellow Disney stars did. She's had quite a few projects added to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her IMDb resume</a> since 'Good Luck Charlie' ended in 2014, but she also pursued a different path than most.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rather than diving head-first into growing her acting or music career, Bridgit opted for college, defining her career goals in anthropology in 2013. By 2020, Bridgit&nbsp;shared that she received her graduate degree from MIT and that she was planning to pursue a Ph.D.</p><h2 id=what-is-bridgit-mendler-doing-now>What Is Bridgit Mendler Doing Now?</h2><p>While she's likely knee-deep in her studies these days, Bridgit has made time for other adventures. For one thing, she got married in 2019. But the actress is still an artist at heart, and she's got something fun planned for fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her last song came out years ago, but it doesn't mean she's done singing or songwriting yet. And with every other Disney star out there releasing hit after hit, hopefully Bridgit is next!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Bridgit Mendler Announces New Music Is Coming And Fans Are Freaking Out" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bridgit Mendler Announces New Music Is Coming And Fans Are Freaking Out</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6GUnLa1ecyepZ2klad6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dane-cook-net-worth-35-million-lifestyle.html><span>←</span><span>Here's How Comedian Dane Cook Spends His $35 Million Net Worth</span></a>
