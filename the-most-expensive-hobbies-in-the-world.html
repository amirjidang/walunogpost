There are various kinds of hobbies that people get into, from the simple to the complex ones, and from the cheap to the expensive ones.

You get to experience a certain amount of free-fall, then time yourself to open your parachute if you are near land. To land safely, you should know a variety of techniques on slowing down your fall, as well as controlling your parachute. Training is needed to do this variety of techniques, and it is expensive.</p><p>This extreme and expensive sport costs around $250 - $300 per single tandem jump, and an average of $1,500 for a package of 7-10 jumps.

If you do have the funds and you want an extreme hobby, this one is for you.</p><h2 id=drag-racing><b>Drag Racing</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you have an urge for speed and love to burn the rubber, you may want to consider drag racing. Here is a walkthrough on what the sport is all about. Each driver is allowed to perform a burnout to boost their start speed. Racers then line up from the start line and the release on the brakes are then determined on a signaling device called the Christmas tree. The Christmas tree is like a traffic light, but has different kinds of lights on it. The drivers should wait for the green light to be lit up before they launch. The first one to go past the finish line wins. Players should follow rules at all times, and a red light will be seen on the Christmas Tree if there are any violations.</p><p>In order for you to reach over 300 miles per hours, you should use a special kind of fuel, which is a combination of methanol and nitro-methane. The expenses you need to cover in getting your own vehicle, purchasing drag racing car parts and maintaining the vehicle itself can range from $200,000 – $1 million.</p><h2 id=collecting-cars><b>Collecting Cars</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This hobby is obviously for can-afford guys only. There are different of kinds of cars to collect and each collector typically caters to 1 or more types of these. There are muscle cars, vintage cars, luxury cars, sedans, 4x4 trucks, SUVS, convertibles, off-roaders, sports cars, and racing cars. Each type of car has different features and styles, and price range varies also. Most car collectors usually go for the unique and rare cars. The rarer they are, the more money you have to shell out.&nbsp;Just how expensive are they? A classic 1937 Bugatti Type 57S costs $4.4 million while a 1961 Ferrari California costs $10.8 million.

Different types of art like statues, paintings, and sculptures are priced from thousands of dollars to millions. If you are considering acquiring the best “collection” of rare art, a million dollars will not be enough. Even a couple thousand dollars will not be enough if you are a starter and want real art, not reproductions. The artwork entitled “The Card Players” done by Paul Cezanne is considered the most expensive work of art ever sold, with a tag price of $250 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGaln6jBbrHXqZynq5mrsm60zpuZop2jYravedOhnGavn6e5pXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teri-garrs-net-worth-age-height-weight-husband-kids-bio-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Teri Garrs Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
