His mission in the film is to rescue his wife, who was kidnapped. The movie made about $22 Million at the box office. It was not considered a success. Most of the critics claimed that the movie was a bad film.</p><p>Despite all that, after 17 years since the movie was released, it has become a hit on the online streaming platform <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>. The film was watched by over five million viewers in the week between December 18th and 24th. This film also marks the first time it made it on Netflix’s Global Top Ten list.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The Marine also had a series of films featuring The Miz, Shawn Michaels, Becky Lynch, Naomi (Trinity Fatu), Ted Dibiase Jr., and many more.</p><h2 id=h-mjf-shares-what-he-and-john-cena-spoke-about-at-the-iron-claw-premiere>MJF shares what he and John Cena spoke about at the Iron Claw premiere</h2><p>The 16-time WWE World Heavyweight Champion was also recently spotted at The Iron Claw‘s movie Premiere. There, he spent some time with one of the stars in the film, The AEW World Heavyweight Champion MJF.</p><p>During an interview with <a href=#>SE Scoops</a>, MJF <a href=#>shared</a> what he and John Cena spoke about.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s unprofessional for me to discuss what we talked about. He didn’t have to do this, and it meant the world to me. [John Cena] walked over to me, and he said he’s a fan of my work, and he respected my professionalism.</p><p>“Once we were on the red carpet, we talked some more and I told him straight up, I said, ‘You’re an inspiration’ because he is, you know? There are a lot of people in my industry who phone it in. I cannot recall one time in the over a decade of John Cena’s career where he phoned it in even once. He’s incapable, just like I’m incapable. He is a tremendous role model. Not just for me as a professional wrestler, but for everybody around the world, because he teaches you how important hard work is,” MJF said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsaWtsaWK3sLTNZpqeppGoerW0xGakmqqZo7JursScpqado2KubsPOq6Odr5mZsm60yK1kqKZdo7K1ssuirw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessie-james-deckers-brother-john-celebrates-bond-after-drama.html><span>←</span><span>Jessie James Deckers Brother John Celebrates Bond After Drama</span></a>
