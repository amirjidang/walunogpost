He switched multiple schools until he found his calling in drama and arts. After completing his education and moving to New York, Theroux painted murals and became a bartender for a living. After appearing in minor recurring roles in television shows and doing off-Broadway shows, he found his <a href=#>big break in David Lynch’s 2001 neo-noir mystery</a> Mulholland Drive. The movie earned him recognition and opened a flood gate of potential movie roles and television shows. He also established himself as a talented filmmaker and screenwriter in the coming years, writing some of his most successful movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An actor with a lot of potential, Justin Theroux is also a talented artist known for creating stunning illustrations on canvas and designing book covers. A man with many talents,</p><h2 id=theroux-s-acting-credits>Theroux's Acting Credits</h2><p>Justin Theroux made his debut in 1996 in an episode of C.P.W, followed by his small appearance in the 1997 movie I Shot Andy Warhol. He began guest-starring in shows like Ally McBeal and Sex And The City until he received a steady role and a 27-episode arc on the CBS show The District. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, he played supporting roles in American Psycho and The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy. The breakthrough role that launched him into stardom came with David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive, one of Lynch’s most popular movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2003, he appeared in Charlie’s Angles: Full Throttle and acted in Six Feet Under, a critically acclaimed HBO television show. He earned a Screen Actor’s Guild Award nomination with the Ensemble Cast for the role. He reunited with Lynch for the 2006 mystery thriller Inland Empire and, a few years later, guest-starred in NBC’s Parks And Recreation. He pursued work as a screenwriter until he landed a lead role in The Leftovers HBO series. As stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the actor earned $75,000 per episode to star in the super national show and won an Emmy for his performance.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>8 Ways Ryan Gosling Earns And Spends His Millions</a></span></p><p>While working on the show, Theroux also starred in The Girl On The Train, Lego Ninja Movie, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, The Spy Who Dumped Me, and many more movies. While Theroux has slowed down his acting career, he continues to make one movie a year. He was a supporting <a href=#>actor in Joker in 2019</a> that made $1.074 billion at the box office. He lent his voice in the 2019 animated movie The Lady And The Tramp to portray the character of The Tramp.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=through-film-making-and-screen-writing>Through Film Making And Screen Writing</h2><p>After working with one of his favorite directors David Lynch in two movies, the actor considers Lynch, his mentor. Justin Theroux learned from him to be free with his artistic expression rather than worrying about doing something wrong. After working with him on his second movie in 2006, he became an executive producer and director for the 2007 comedy-drama Dedication. He has also produced the HBO miniseries The White House Plumbers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Theroux couldn’t read until he was in high school but coming from a background of writers and journalists, he knew he had the natural talent to succeed in that field. He teamed up with Ben Stiller to write the script for the 2008 action comedy Tropic Thunder which made $195.7 million. After the movie's success, he became a writer high in demand. He was offered the opportunity to co-write the script for Iron Man 2, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atlantic</a>. The movie earned $623.9 million at the box office. Theroux had once mentioned that he found writing screenplays more challenging than acting as it involved meticulous hours of planning. Still, the results were more satisfying for him than a movie project.</p><h2 id=a-talented-illustrator>A Talented Illustrator</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming from a creative arts background from his college, Justin Theroux had a foggy plan about pursuing a career in the same field. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, he painted murals outside the swankiest clubs in Manhattan, including the Limelight and the Palladium. After years of working in successful movies, Theroux still finds time to make illustrations on paper but not that often. Fans catch a glimpse of his work through his social media account, where he uploads photos and videos of his painting processes. He has also created illustrations for his <a href=#>dear friend and author Amy Sedaris</a>. He drew the covers of her two novels, I Like You and Simple Times. The actor is inspired by daily life and believes that every day is an inspiration. He has maintained a diary since he was young to note down daily musings that inspire him to create art.</p><p>Justin Theroux has more talent than meets the eye, from establishing himself as a successful actor through supporting roles and becoming a leading man for HBO to showing his creative side through his screenwriting and illustrations. The actor was last seen starring in the 2021 Apple TV+ television series The Mosquito Coast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Inside Tyler, The Creator’s $7.9 Million Mid-Century Modern Bel Air Home</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atlantic</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSubrjOqKJmoZ6otqWxjKOsrKyZo3q1tMSrpq6wo2KBcXnMoqOloZ%2Bjeqe70a2sp51f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./90210-actor-ian-ziering-says-he-was-attacked-by-people-mini-bikes-hollywood.html><span>←</span><span>90210 actor Ian Ziering says he was attacked by people on minibikes in Hollywood WSOC TV</span></a>
