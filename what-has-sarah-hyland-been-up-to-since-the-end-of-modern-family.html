The 30-year-old actress spent so many years on the popular sitcom, and now fans are wondering what she has in store.</p><h2 id=starring-in-the-wedding-year>Starring In 'The Wedding Year'</h2><p>Since&nbsp;Modern Family&nbsp;just came to an end in April 2020, Sarah Hyland doesn't have many new roles, especially since the finale aired at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The actress does have a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$14 million net worth from starring on the sitcom</a>.</p><p>But she did star in one movie that fans really enjoyed watching:&nbsp;The Wedding Year.

The actress explained, "I, fortunately, have parents who are not divorced and who have had a very loving and healthy relationship from the get-go. So if you don’t believe in marriage, that was a big deal-breaker for me before I got engaged. It was a lot of fun to delve into the psychology of Mara's views because I didn't fully understand it. It was a lot of fun to be able to go into her ticks and see why she's wired the way that she is. I know a lot of people like that, so it was really fun to be able to talk about their experiences with their parents and really create this character."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hyland&nbsp;said that she loved shooting one scene at a wedding with a lot of dancing in it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Say This Is The Best Character From ‘Modern Family’</a></span></p><h2 id=wedding-planning>Wedding Planning</h2><p>There's one big thing that has happened in Sarah Hyland's personal life: in the summer of 2019, she and Wells Adams got engaged.</p><p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they decided to move their wedding to a later date.
