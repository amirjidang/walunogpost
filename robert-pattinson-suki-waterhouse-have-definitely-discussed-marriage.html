Us confirmed in August of that year that the Lost City of Z actor and the model <a href=#>had been “dating for months”</a> after knowing each other “for a long time.”</p><p>It wasn’t until April 2019 that Pattinson first addressed his relationship with Waterhouse. He told The Sunday Times that talking about his partner publicly and letting “people in … devalues what love is” for him.</p><p>Three years later, the couple made their first red carpet appearance together in December 2022 at the Dior pre-fall 2023 menswear show in Egypt.</p><p>Waterhouse proceeded to give fans insight into her relationship with Pattinson, telling <a href=# rel=noopener>The Sunday Times</a> in February, “I’m shocked that I’m so happy with someone for nearly five years. … I’m always incredibly excited when I see his name pop up [on my phone] or even a text, and I think he feels the same about me. We’ve always got so much to say, and I find him hilarious.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Pattinson and Waterhouse showed they were still happily in love while attending the <a href=#>2023 Met Gala in May</a>. As they walked the red carpet, the duo couldn’t stop smiling. They even shared a kiss, which sent fans into a tizzy.</p><p>That same month, <a href=#>a source exclusively told Us </a>that Pattinson is Waterhouse’s “greatest fan” and is “so happy for her success” after her Prime Video project, Daisy Jones & The Six, premiered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5Kav7V5z5qrraGeqLyvedKuoqJlp5bBpr7HqKysnV2drrexjJ2cn6GensGmuNhmm6Krk6rAtLHDZqSaqqKerqixjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rihanna-and-asap-rockys-swaggy-couple-style-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Rihanna and ASAP Rockys Swaggy Couple Style: Photos</span></a>
