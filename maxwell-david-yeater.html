The Police searched the trail on foot, utilized area K-9 units, and called in DRONE operators to search by air; “all with negative results,” wrote the Westport Police in an update to the case on their social media. The Police enlisted the help of citizens and appealed to them to inform the Police if they had any information on the whereabouts of Maxwell.</p><p>They were contacted by a friend of Maxwell who said he had received a call from Maxwell and provided the phone number from where the call was placed to the Police. The Westport Police investigated the phone number and found that the phone number was associated with WI-FI calling kiosks in New York City, which led the Police to believe that Maxwell had made his way to New York City. The Westport Police attempted to contact Maxwell directly as well.</p><p></p><p>The Westport Police Detective Bureau worked diligently on the case through Sunday, following several tips that led to New York City. With the help of Law Enforcement sharing and social media platforms, the Westport Police were able to locate Maxwell Yeater in New York City Library in the vicinity of Grand Central station. He was reunited with his family at approximately 5:00 pm.</p><p>The Westport Police expressed gratitude towards the Public, Law Enforcement Partners, and Media for their assistance in reuniting Maxwell with his family. The Westport Police had posted a missing person report on their social media, appealing to the general public to help locate the missing teen. The description read as follows,</p><p>“On November 18, 2023, at approximately 3:30 pm, Westport Police responded to a report of a missing 15-year-old juvenile from the Newman’s Preservatory Trail off 307-309 Bayberry Lane.
