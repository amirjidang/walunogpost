<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>The Importance of Creating a Killer Logo for Your Brand</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>When I first launched ZacJohnson.com over <a href=#>five years ago</a>, I wanted to start fresh but leave a lasting impression. The focus of the site would be on the content, but the design and logo would get people to remember the name and look of the site. Jump ahead five years and it’s been working extremely well. The “Zac Johnson” toon is recognized all over in the affiliate/internet marketing space. This is branding at it’s best!</p><p>If you are looking to start your own blog, web site or business, I highly recommend going with a unique and creative logo design for the site. No matter what site I am building, I like to make sure the site has a great and memorable logo from day one. Logo design work used to cost a lot of money. I’ve spent several hundred dollars on logo designs that now can be designed or much cheaper rates. It’s all about knowing where to look and seeing what services out there offer the best pricing and quality designs.</p><h2>Leaving a Lasting Impression</h2><p>When it comes time for you to create a logo of your own, the important thing to think about is how you will want your logo to look and the message that it portrays. <a href=# rel=noopener>Logo Design Team</a> is an excellent service for getting logo design work done. They have an excellent portfolio that you can look through and it will also help you plan out the <a href=# rel=noopener>design process</a> for your logo.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Logo Design Impressions" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Logo-Design-Impressions.jpg alt width=645 height=158 sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Here are some of the questions you will want to ask yourself before submitting a design for your logo creation.</p><ul><li>What colors do I want to use, and that represent my brand and web site?</li><li>Are you going to have a graphic designed or something with text?</li><li>What is your budget for design work? (more complex = higher prices)</li><li>Will other people understand what your logo / company is and does?</li></ul><p>Asking yourself these questions before creating your logo can save you and your logo designer a lot of time. Once you receive your drafts, be sure to send them around to friends to see what they think as well. Since you know what your brand and company does, it’s important to get fresh opinions from other people who don’t.</p><h3>Design Packages for Every Budget</h3><p>We keep mentioning that it’s important to plan your budget out before creating your logo design. This is important for many different reasons, especially that many design services offer packages of all sizes. The more complex and high quality your logo is, and time consuming to design… the higher the cost. However, this doesn’t mean that you need to blow the bank on a logo design. Many design services like Logo Design Team have packages for under $100, which makes it easy for anyone to create a visual brand for their business.</p><p>You can see a full break down of the different design packages offered from Logo Design Team. Packages start at just $69 and go all the way up to $499 for their mega package that includes everything you need to create an identity and includes stationary as well.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async title="Logo Design Team Packages" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Logo-Design-Team-Packages.jpg alt width=650 height=342 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>I’ve always been a huge fan of sites with great logo designs. With only a few seconds to leave a lasting impression before someone leaves your site and may not come back, an attractive and memorable logo design is one of the best ways to connect with your audience. If you don’t currently have a logo to represent your identity, be sure to contact the <a title="Logo Design Team" href=# rel=noopener>Logo Design Team</a> and see what they can create for you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiykZi3sLTNrKanZpOkunDAx55koqWgpL%2B1rc2cnGanlmKws7HAraCnn12Weqy1y6Wcq2WcpLSwecWoqWaxn6q%2Fbq7RmqWdZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stanley-kubrick-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Stanley Kubrick Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
