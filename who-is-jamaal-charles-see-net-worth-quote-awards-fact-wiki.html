Charles is one of the top performers in the league, having four Pro Bowl selections, two First-team All-Pro, and was the NFL rushing touchdowns leader. Charles’ career has been active since 2008.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Jamaal Charles is, as of mid-2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Jamaal Charles’ net worth is as high as $13 million, an amount earned through his successful career in the NFL.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=jamaal-charles-net-worth-13-million></span>Jamaal Charles Net Worth $13 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jamaal Charles suffered from a learning disability when he was a child, and even competed at the Special Olympics at the age of 10. There he found out how fast he was, and later in high school and college Charles ran in several disciplines including 60m, 100m, and 200m, recording excellent results – his personal bests are 6.65 seconds for 60 meters, 10.13 for 100 meters, and 20.62 for the 200 meters. Charles also played football for his high school Port Arthur (TX) Memorial, and later at the Texas University. Jamaal finished fourth on the list of best running backs at the University with 3,328 yards in total. Only Ricky Williams, Cedric Benson, and Earl Campbell have recorded more.</p><p>In 2008, the Kansas City Chiefs selected Charles as the 73rd pick in the third round of the NFL Draft; he was listed as the team’s No.3 running back behind Larry Johnson and Kolby Smith. In his rookie year, Charles had 357 rushing yards and 272 receiving yards with a touchdown. The next season, Charles was promoted to the No.1 running back on the depth chart following Larry Johnson’s release, and he recorded 1,120 rushing yards for seven touchdowns, including a 76-yard run for a score against the Buffalo Bills. Charles became the only running back in NFL history to rush for 1,100 or more yards in 200 or fewer carries. His net worth was assured.</p><p>In 2010, Charles had an even better season and recorded a most impressive 1,467 yards for five rushing touchdowns on 230 carries. He also added three receiving touchdowns that year, and was selected to his first Pro Bowl while being added to the NFL All-Pro team. However, the 2011 season was the worst in Charles’ career; he suffered an ACL injury in the second week and was placed on the injured reserve list, missing the rest of the season.</p><p>However, he had a great comeback in 2012, recording a career-best 1,509 rushing yards for five touchdowns, including the longest run in his career – 91-yards for a touchdown against the Indianapolis Colts. Charles earned his place at the Pro Bowl event, and broke the Jim Brown’s 47-year standing record of 5.22 yards per carry, averaging 5.82. In 2013, Charles experienced the best scoring season in his career, recording 12 rushing and seven receiving touchdowns which led to his participation in the Pro Bowl, and also securing his a spot at the All-Pro for the second time. The following season, Charles signed a two-year contract extension with the Chiefs worth of $18.1 million, making him one of the top five paid running backs in the league. He had another solid season for 1,033 yards and nine touchdowns, and was selected to his fourth Pro Bowl.</p><p>However, after played only five games in the 2015 season, Charles tore the ACL in his right knee and was forced to miss the remainder of the year. In his eight-year career in the NFL to date, Charles has recorded 7,220 rushing yards in 1,320 attempts, 2,443 receiving yards on 283 catches, and 64 touchdowns in total. He is currently holding the NFL record at 5.5 rushing yards per carry.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Jamaal Charles married Whitney Charles in 2012, and the pair has two daughters together.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jamaal Charles</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$13 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 27, 1986</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Port Arthur, TX</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5′ 11″</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>199 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Football running back</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Texas at Austin, Memorial High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Whitney Golden</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Makaila Charles, Makenzie Charles</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Sharon Charles</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Shanderric Charles</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/JamaalCharlesOfficial</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>https://twitter.com/jcharles25</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/djcharles25/</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://imdb.com/name/nm2994803</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Fantasy Player of the Year, NFL Honors – FedEx Ground Player of the Year</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Best NFL Player ESPY Award</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head><span class=ez-toc-section id=self></span>Self <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table class=self><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>NFL Monday Night Football</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself – Kansas City Chiefs Running Back</td></tr><tr><td>The NFL on CBS</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself – Kansas City Chiefs Running Back</td></tr><tr><td>Rome Is Burning</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head><span class=ez-toc-section id=archive-footage></span>Archive Footage <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table class=archive_footage><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Mike & Mike</td><td>2013-2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself – Kansas City Chiefs / Himself – Kansas City Chiefs Running Back</td></tr></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1frLWwecisZKOZnZaurXnCoZirpJWoerSxxGalnqxdrLyzwMdmqK6npJp6osPAq5usZZaWsLV51qKiomc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-andrew-crawford-lawyer-from-brown-rudnick-here-is-what-we-know-about-johnny-depp-legal-team.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Andrew Crawford Lawyer from Brown Rudnick?
