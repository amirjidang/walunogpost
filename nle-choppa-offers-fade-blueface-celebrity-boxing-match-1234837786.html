He called out Choppa and his baby’s mother in <a href=#>JaidynAlexis’ “Barbie (Remix)”</a> which dropped on Wednesday (Jan. 3), rapping about how she wants to have sex with him. He then took things to X, <a href=#>formerly known as Twitter</a>, writing, “Ni**as rap about my wesydes all year long and mad when I rap about his… She decided to indulge in the circus on her own free recognizance she entered the chat nobody safe. I’m not worried about a Muslim vegan cryp on sY bet that small fry… squabble up or shut up.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He had a few more tweets after, doubling down on the fact the “<a href=#>Sl*t Me Out</a>” artist’s baby mother wanted to have sex with him, claiming that he “put lil bro on,” and then wondering why he wasn’t getting any responses.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Niggas rap about my wesydes all year long and mad when I rap about his…she decided to indulge in the circus on her own free recognizance she entered the chat nobody safe ??

Rock brought it up last month during her latest back-and-forth with her ex-boyfriend, claiming he was unsuccessful in his attempt because he has “no [rizz].”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It is unclear who was flirting with whom, but it seems Choppa and Blueface are ready to settle things in the ring. The “<a href=#>Thotiana</a>” rapper has been successful in his short amateur boxing career. Last year, he defeated Ed Matthews by TKO and he defeated Kane Trujillo in 2021.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6O5pnnCoaapqJFivKeyxKuqZp6RmbJursuunJ%2BZk5p6pLHLnpmroaSueqO716KloGWdlsGktIxqaWxsaGiEeISVaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nejc-brusar.html><span>←</span><span>Nejc Brusar - Player profile</span></a>
