However, the Black Widow actress hasn’t had the best luck at love. Over the years, Johansson’s had her fair share of failed relationships, from her incredibly short marriage to <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>Ryan Reynolds</a></strong> to a quick relationship with Sean Penn, who ended up turning her down because he didn’t want to commit to something more serious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/matt-damon-s-intimate-scene-with-scarlett-johansson-turned-into-a-nightmare-to-shoot.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Matt Damon's Intimate Scene With Scarlett Johansson Turned Into A Nightmare To Shoot</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Matt Damon revealed his kiss with Scarlett Johansson in ‘We Bought a Zoo’ turned into a disaster.</span><h2 id=sean-penn-only-dated-scarlett-johansson-briefly-because-he-wasn-rsquo-t-ready-to-commit>Sean Penn Only Dated Scarlett Johansson Briefly Because He Wasn’t Ready To Commit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sean-penn-looking-upset.jpg><p>Over the years, Scarlett Johansson has been linked to many celebrities, from Jared Leto to French journalist and art collector <a href=# rel=nofollow>Romain Dauriac, with whom she shares a daughter</a>. Back in the spring of 2011, the Black Widow actress sparked some new romance rumors when she was spotted grabbing lunch with Mystic River star Sean Penn, less than a year after her <a href=# rel=nofollow>divorce from Ryan Reynolds</a>. The two gave the media a lot to talk about, especially for their significant age age. After all, Johansson was 26, while Penn was 50 years old at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two had met after Johansson flew to Haiti to help people affected by the two earthquakes in January 2010. "Scarlett first reached out to Sean when she was planning to visit Haiti with Oxfam. She knew Sean was living there in a tent and turned to him for advice," a source close to the actors revealed.</p><p>After a series of dates in L.A., the pair were spotted vacationing together in Mexico. Not shortly after, the two made their relationship public when they attended <a href=# rel=nofollow>Reese Witherspoon’s wedding to talent agent Jim Toth</a> in March 2011. A month later, the two attended a White House Correspondents' Dinner party in Washington, D.C. as a couple.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/scarlett-johansson-finally-addressed-the-disturbing-rumor-ignited-by-benicio-del-toro-front-commons-license-back-instar.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Scarlett Johansson Finally Addressed The Rumor Ignited By Benicio Del Toro</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Scarlett Johansson was clearly fed up of a disturbing rumor that followed her for years, linking the actress to Benicio del Toro.</span><p>Their relationship turned serious rather quickly. Only a couple of months after they were first spotted together, the young actress had practically <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">moved into Penn’s Malibu home</a>. "She's at his house most nights and has been accepted by his teenage sons. Things have moved at a fast pace and both feel they have found their perfect match," an insider told Glamour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the move very early on, their romance was rather short-lived. By June 2011, <strong>Johansson and Penn had split up</strong>. A source close to the actor, revealed that the reason for their breakup was that the actor wasn’t looking for anything “serious” so shortly after his divorce from Robin Wright.</p><h2 id=sean-penn-39-s-relationship-with-scarlett-johansson-cost-him-his-longest-friendships>Sean Penn's Relationship With Scarlett Johansson Cost Him His Longest Friendships</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/scarlett-johansson-and-sean-penn.jpeg><p>In 2012, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Scarlett Johansson finally opened up about her short-lived relationship with Academy Award winner Sean Penn</a>. “We spent time together, yeah,” Johansson told Vogue. “I never put a title on it, really, but we were seeing each other.” The actress pointed out that she didn’t like the fact that their relationship gathered so much attention. She said that the fuss over her and Penn “was a little bit of an adjustment.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although their relationship ended rather abruptly, it seems that the two ended things on good terms.
