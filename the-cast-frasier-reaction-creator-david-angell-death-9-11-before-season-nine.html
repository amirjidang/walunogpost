The tragic and infuriating reason for that is Angell passed away before production on that season began.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/your-paragraph-text-2023-08-23t103107-020.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kelsey Grammer Broke Down In Tears With Kelly Ripa And Ryan Seacrest Discussing His 'Best Thing He's Ever Done' In Hollywood</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kelsey Grammer isn't known for emotional interviews, but his time alongside Ryan Seacrest and Kelly Ripa took an unexpected twist.</span><p>On September 11th, 2001, Frasier's cast and crew were just as shocked by the attack that unfolded as everyone else. As the day progressed, however, the traumatizing nature of that day became more heartbreaking for everyone involved with Frasier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kelsey-grammer-s-addiction-issues-may-have-canceled-frasier-had-it-not-been-for-david-hyde-pierce.jpg><p>In the hours that followed the tragedy of that day, the cast of Frasier learned the news that Angell and his wife Lynn Angell had both lost their lives.

Based on those comments, it seems like Angell was a lovely human being who truly was adored by the people who got to know him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-design-(9).jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an interview, Frasier's Peri Gilpin remembered her experiences on September 11th 2001. Most notably, Gilpin described the terrible <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">moment when she learned that David and Lynn Angell had lost their lives</a>.</p><p>"She called back and told me David and Lynn had been on that first plane." As an emotional Gilpin shook her head no, she described her reaction at that moment. "I was just in so much shock."</p><p>As Gilpin continued to remember Angell, she spoke about the positive influence he had over her career. Gilpin also spoke about how funny Gilpin was as a person and a writer. Most importantly, Gilpin lavished praise on who Angell was as a human being. "He was a really funny, classy, kind, cool, smart guy." Gilpin also expressed her love for Lynn Angell and the work the couple did to help people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/what-happened-to-david-hyde-pierce-after-frasier_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>David Hyde Pierce Rejecting The Frasier Reboot Completely Changed The Show Creatively, According To Kelsey Grammer</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>David Hyde Pierce decided to turn down the Frasier reboot offer and it would lead to Kelsey Grammer making major changes.</span><p>Just like Gilpin, Jane Leeves was interviewed about her experiences on September 11th, 2011. During Leeves' interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was so emotional about losing Angell</a> that she had to take a moment to collect herself before she could continue talking.</p><p>As Leeves explained, she was freaked out after the attack, so she went to a supermarket to stock up on goods for her family. When she returned home, Leeves' husband gave her the tragic news as the actor described while fighting back tears.</p><p>"He said that, um, our executive producer, David Angell and Lynn, it had been confirmed that they were in the first plane to hit the towers. And I just dropped to my knees. It was really shocking." As Leeves' interview continued, she made her admiration for Angell clear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jane-leeves.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"David was a magnificent human being. The most elegant man you'd ever care to meet. The most kind, charming man and devastatingly funny. Which was so surprising coming out of this elegant white-bearded gentleman." Leeves then went on to be just as complimentary of Lynn Angell.</p><p>"His wife, Lynn, was everything you'd expect him to be attracted to. She was a beautiful, kind, wonderful woman. She was a school librarian." Leeves continued, "She was the kindest, gentlest woman. We were all very close." "It was just devastating, just devastating."</p><p>In 2018, Vanity Fair published an oral history of Frasier. For that piece, Vanity Fair's writer Marc Freeman spoke to Kelsey Grammer, David Hyde Pierce, Peri Gilpin, Jane Leeves, as well as co-creators Peter Casey and David Lee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kelsey-grammer.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kelsey Grammer Had To Defend Himself After He Was Caught Bringing His Three-Month-Old Along To The Playboy Mansion</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kelsey Grammer had to do lots of damage control after he took part in a Playboy mansion Halloween party with his newborn.</span><p>Partway through Vanity Fair's article, the subject of Angell's passing came up. In response, David Hyde Pierce briefly described <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how he reacted when he learned about Angell's passing</a>.</p><p>"I collapsed to the floor without even thinking. The impossibility of it. Not just because it was someone we knew, but because they were two of the best people that ever walked the earth. It was an inconceivable loss of those two beautiful human beings."</p><p>Throughout Kelsey Grammer's life, he has suffered far too many tragedies. In 2021, he reflected on one of them when <a href=#>Grammer spoke to Deadline about learning that Angell passed</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Untitled-design---2022-02-06T201828206.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It is a day of loss that I always remember. “I was awakened by a friend of mine who lives in New York. He said, ‘They got us, they got us, they’ve taken out the World Trade towers.’ I turned on the TV and saw what was going on."</p><p>Grammer continued, "I remember I’d invited David and his wife to come to a party that weekend; I spoke to him on Saturday. He said, ‘Oh, we were going to come home, but we decided we’d stay an extra couple of days. We’re going to come back on Tuesday.’ “</p><p>Grammer went on to talk about how losing Angell felt. “He was a terrific writer. He was also a really nice guy. It was great to know him, and so losing him was something everybody felt like a gut shot.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dmK60wIyfqZqrmZq%2Fbr7EmpqtoZ%2BjeqS%2BxJqrqKpdma63tcNmmKeflaG5brDEmquhZWlifnJ5wZ6dqKqVYsCmrdKopWammaOycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tara-reid-extremely-skinny-bikini-body-photos-201565.html><span>←</span><span>Tara Reid Flashes Her Extremely Skinny Body in String Bikinis: Photos</span></a>
