However, not every actor in Hollywood has been bitten by the superhero bug. Let's look at some celebrities that have turned down superhero roles and why they refuse to be in superhero movies.</p><h2 id=jodie-foster><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Jodie Foster</span></h2><p>Jodie Foster is one of Hollywood's most successful celebrities, appearing in classics, like&nbsp;Silence of the Lambs, Taxi Driver,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Maverick.&nbsp;She has a wide range, appearing in thrillers, action flicks, and even comedies. She has even taken on directing, showing off her expertise directing movies like&nbsp;The Beaver and&nbsp;Money Monster.</p><p>One thing she will absolutely not do is ever star in or direct a superhero movie, claiming <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"It’s ruining the viewing habits of the American population and then ultimately the rest of the world.”</a>&nbsp;She's not a fan of the trend and will most likely never appear in any MCU or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DCEU</a> movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-statham><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jason Statham</span></h2><p>Jason Statham is one of the biggest action stars in Hollywood, being a part of big franchises and known as an overall badass. It would be amazing to see him take on a superhero role or maybe even a villain role in a superhero movie, but unfortunately, that will most likely never happen.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Hidden Gem Movies On Netflix Right Now" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Hidden Gem Movies On Netflix Right Now</a></span></p><p>When asked about him ever being in a superhero movie, he didn't mince words and said&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Anybody can do it",</a> saying that all the green screens and stunt doubles take away from the authentic experience.</p><h2 id=rose-mcgowan><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rose Mcgowan</span></h2><p>Rose Mcgowan has been in a handful of movies throughout the years, just not superhero ones. Mcgowan is most well-known for her role in&nbsp;Scream&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charmed</a>&nbsp;and has decided to stick to thrillers or slasher films.</p><p>In an interview, she was highly critical of the genre, claiming that it was played out heavily "I don't want green goblins and tight outfits. I want intelligence, daring, work that drives society forward. I want a mirror, not every cliche regurgitated."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mel-gibson><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mel Gibson</span></h2><p>Mel Gibson has had a love-hate relationship with Hollywood, being a talented actor/director, but also being the subject to plenty of scandals. He has made some of the greatest movies to date and is well known for his realistic practical effects and his extreme method acting.</p><p>So it's no surprise that the old thespian would be against superhero movies, claiming that studios waste money on these big movies and they still tank. He also claims that the repetitive reboots like Spider-man or Batman are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ruining the experience</a>.</p><h2 id=josh-hartnett><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Josh Hartnett</span></h2><p>A name a lot of people haven't heard in a long time is Josh Hartnett. The 42-year-old actor has retired from acting, claiming that it was only part of his journey and he always had plans to do other things besides being in front of a camera. As a handsome, young, and tall actor, he has been offered many superhero roles throughout the years, including Superman, Batman, and even Spider-man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Spider-Man: Far From Home: Marisa Tomei Is Fed Up Of Playing The Role Of " href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spider-Man: Far From Home: Marisa Tomei Is Fed Up Of Playing The Role Of "The Mom"</a></span></p><p>He turned down the roles because he did not want to get defined as a superhero for the rest of his career, he wanted to make his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">own name for himself</a>.</p><h2 id=jon-hamm><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jon Hamm</span></h2><p>Making his claim to fame in the hit show&nbsp;Mad Men,&nbsp; Jon Hamm has been connected to several superhero roles throughout the years and even heavily considered to play Batman on several occasions.</p><p>In 2011, he was even asked to play the Green Lantern before the role went to Ryan Reynolds, claiming it was something that he didn't want to do. He went into further explaining his refusal to do superhero movies by saying there is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">too much risk </a>in signing up and having to do multiple movie deals on scripts that haven't been written or without knowing the success of the movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-beckinsale><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kate Beckinsale</span></h2><p>Kate Beckinsale is best known for her work in the&nbsp;Underworld&nbsp;franchise and is one of the most sought out female action stars. Due to her roles, she was even approached to play the mightiest female hero of them all in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wonder Woman </a>but turned the role because she wasn't a fan of the script or the costume.</p><p>Even though she didn't necessarily say she wouldn't make a superhero movie, she did say she's concerned wearing the costumes would one day <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">embarrass her kids</a>.</p><h2 id=amanda-seyfried><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Amanda Seyfried</span></h2><p>Amanda Seyfried has been in several comedies and romantic movies, often playing the love interest or the unlikely hero. As a talented actress, she was offered the role of Gamora in the&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy but turned it down due to the commitment she would've had to make for the role.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="American Horror Story Season 10: What We Know So Far" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Horror Story Season 10: What We Know So Far</a></span></p><p>In an interview promoting one of her latest movies, she was asked about&nbsp;turning down a superhero role and she said: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Part of me wishes I had done it, but the other part of me is like, 'I had a life to live,' and I don't think I would've been happy."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jennifer Aniston</span></h2><p>Jennifer Anniston is one of the biggest stars in Hollywood today, appearing in hundreds of movies and tv shows, across all genres. One genre we have never seen her in, and will probably never see her in is the superhero genre.</p><p>Like many of the actors on this list, she doesn't think the movies are authentic saying <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“You’re seeing what’s available out there and it’s just diminishing and diminishing in terms of, it’s big Marvel movies or things that I’m not just asked to do or really that interested in living in a green screen.”</a>&nbsp;It is a shame because she definitely has the chops to play big-name characters, we will just never see her take them on.</p><h2 id=martin-scorsese><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Martin Scorsese</span></h2><p>Arguably one of the greatest directors of our time and a cinematic genius, Martin Scorsese has made some of the best movies of all time. With his genius and expert storytelling, we'd love to see him direct the next big superhero film but that will most likely never happen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scorsese has, through the years, dissed the MCU and DCEU, comparing the experience to theme parks. Although he's not against successful movies like&nbsp;Black Panther <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel movies take away from his vision</a>, and he has said that.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Batman Vs.
