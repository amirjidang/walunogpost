For a show that is all about fairytales and magic, it's interesting that not everything is all rainbows and butterflies on the outside. The series has a lot of dark secrets behind the scenes. Once Upon A Time is all about hope and true love, but behind there scenes there was a lot of drama. Even though the on-screen chemistry was there... it was not like that for everyone off-set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Sebastian Stan Really Felt About Playing The Mad Hatter On ‘Once Upon A Time’</a></span></p><p>The land of Storybrooke consisted of queens, witches, princesses, and a Rumpelstiltskin. Good and evil were always going head-to-head, but good always outweighed the bad. The real-life actors who played these characters were struggling internally throughout the show. <a href=#>The series came to an end in 2018</a> with the seventh and final season. Many members of the cast including Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Lana Parrilla, Jennifer Morrison, Colin O'Donoghue, Jared S. Gilmore, Emilie de Ravin, and Robert Carlyle have created true lifelong friendships... just not with everyone.</p><h2 id=jennifer-morrison-and-lana-parrilla-feuded><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jennifer Morrison And Lana Parrilla Feuded</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emma Swan, <a href=#>played by Jennifer Morrison</a>, and the Evil Queen Regina Mills, played by Lana Parrilla, had a complicated relationship on-screen. Their characters disliked each other at the beginning, but they found a way to work together once Regina chose good over evil. Unfortunately, that is not the case in real life. It has been a known fact in the Once Upon A Time fandom that these two actresses do not get along. They are rarely photographed together or did any joint interviews for the show. They also do not follow each other on Instagram.</p><h2 id=ginnifer-goodwin-and-josh-dallas-39-s-marriage><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ginnifer Goodwin And Josh Dallas's Marriage</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the complete opposite side of the spectrum are Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas' relationship. The pair hit it off so much on-screen that their Prince Charming and Snow White romance became a reality. They had an instant connection, and they knew this was more than just acting. "It's definitely a plus that we get to spend so much time together," Dallas told E! News in November 2012. "I think it adds something; it adds a different dynamic to the characters that we're playing that we can bring to it. It's always a great day going to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">work with Ginnifer Goodwin</a>; she's a fantastic actress and I learn so much from her. We just get to play, so it's nice." Snow White and Prince Charming are the epitome of true love and Ginnifer and Josh's family of four is the true fairytale ending.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Once Upon A Time' Tried And Failed To Get This A-List Singer On The Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robin-hood-and-belle-39-s-cheating-scandal><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Robin Hood And Belle's Cheating Scandal</span></h2><p>The Once cast wasted no time taking their connections off-screen however this relationship was more of a scandal. Tom Ellis, who played Robin Hood in the series, was accused of cheating on his wife Tamzin Outhwaite with Emilie De Ravin. The Australian actress portrayed Disney princess Belle for six seasons. Ellis appeared in a 2013 episode called "Lacey" but never reprised his role in the series. It has since been learned that the alleged affair was a big reason he did not get brought back. Instead, Sean Maguire replaced him as Robin Hood until his character died in season five's episode “Last Rides.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sean-maguire-and-colin-o-39-donoghue-are-besties><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sean Maguire And Colin O'Donoghue Are Besties</span></h2><p>Thank god Robin Hood was re-cast or else fans would have never gotten to relish in the friendship between Sean Maguire and Colin O'Donoghue. Who knew Robin Hood and Captain Hook would get along so well? When Maguire was asked about whom he looked forward to reuniting with onset he responded, "Oh, I mean, all of them. There's not one that I don't love. That's one of the other really strong motivations to go back. I certainly wouldn't be rushing back to a show when I felt like I was already finished on it if it wasn't for a cast that I loved beyond words. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">But Colin is like family to me</a> and Lana and I have such a great relationship and Bex. I feel remiss if I don't mention all of them now. It's that kind of a cast. So, I'm really excited to get back up and have some fun with them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This 'You' Star Played An Iconic Disney Character On 'Once Upon A Time'</a></span></p><h2 id=joanna-garcia-and-jennifer-morrison-are-friends-in-real-life><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>JoAnna Garcia And Jennifer Morrison Are Friends In Real Life</span></h2><p>When JoAnna Garcia joined the series as Ariel she was already good friends with the star of the show, Jennifer Morrison.

"She was at my wedding, and at every big monumental moment in my life, and I think she's so fantastic.
