The screen cracked in the process.</p><p>Nebula reportedly offered him a bottle of alcohol to make up for the situation, though he declined. The man says he’s hired a lawyer and is planning to file a police report and civil lawsuit.</p><p>However, this wasn’t the only physical altercation Travis was involved in that evening. He also allegedly punched a sound engineer after being asked to turn down the sound, which lead to the police being called.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only did Travis allegedly punch the sound tech in the face, but he also reportedly damaged $12,000 of video and speaker equipment.</p><p>The sound engineer later gave an interview to Fx5 detailing his injuries. He said he suffered serious neck injuries and is unbale to turn his head. He’s also experiencing tingling arms.</p><p>“ <a href=#>I was trying to tell him to lower it</a> so it sounded good for the performance," he explained. "But he just stuck his middle finger in my face, so I lowered the monitor a little bit so I could talk to him, and that’s when he ran around the speaker and attacked me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's unclear if the sound engineer also plans to pursue legal action against Travis.</p><p>However, the club has defended Travis following both allegations. "[The situation has been] blown completely out of proportion,” Nebula’s managing partner Ritchie Romero said.</p><p>Travis’ lawyer, Mitchell Schuster, also released a statement defending his client, saying, "While this is clearly a misunderstanding being blown out of proportion by clickbait and misinformation, we are actively working with the venue and law enforcement to resolve and set the record straight.”</p><p>"We are confident our client will be cleared of any wrongdoing,” he continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s been nearly two years since 300 people were injured and 10 died following a crowd surge at Travis’ annual Astroworld festival.
