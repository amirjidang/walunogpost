In Hollywood, most female hot A-listers can get their hands on any man they want, but are they stigmatized if they go out with a much older or younger man? Are these female celebrities still considered cougars if they are dating a younger hunk? No matter what the answers may be to these questions, in Hollywood, just about anything goes when it comes to dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though relationships with a slighter age gap usually last longer, in Hollywood, age ain’t nothing but a number. For decades, troves of Hollywood men have married or dated younger women, but lately, in Hollywood, some feisty female celebrities are giving men a run for their money. Female celebrities are having it their way; whether being cougars on the prowl for younger men or hunting down the silver foxes. In real life, massive age gaps are considered weird and totally odd, but in Hollywood, it is the norm to see huge, and decade over age gaps — nothing wrong with exploring different age groups, huh? And when living the glamourous life in Hollywood that they do, with all the daily pampering and plastic surgery, can we really actually tell the age gap between a foxy A-lister and her beau?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And let's face it, if there is anyone who can shoot down the derogatory cougar label, it is Jennifer Lopez. And for those female celebrities who are dating older men, remember, they are sizzling hot A-listers and they do not need a sugar daddy, so let us push aside that label too. Here is a list of female stars who like their men older and younger.</p><h2 id=eva-mendes-has-a-ring-on-her-finger-from-ryan-gosling><strong>Eva Mendes Has A Ring On Her Finger From Ryan Gosling</strong></h2><p>If men date younger women all the time, then why shouldn't women be allowed? Though some completely disregard the term cougar, we can definitely confirm that actress Eva Mendes defines the word — look at how hot she is; so foxy, sultry, and seductive. Mendes could have had any Hollywood heavyweight next to her on red carpets, but the steamy actress got her hands on the charmer from every women's favorite tear-jerker, The Notebook&nbsp;actor Ryan Gosling.</p><p><strong>This pair make age discrepancy a thing of the past; it is not even evident that this pair have a 9-year age difference.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You go, Mendes —sorry, Mrs. Gosling! We bet any woman would not mind being associated with the label cougar if they had a ring on their finger from Gosling.</p><h2 id=courteney-cox-loves-going-younger><strong>Courteney Cox Loves Going Younger</strong></h2><p>If there is one question that Courteney Cox may hesitate to ask her partners is, "sweetie, remember that episode of me in Friends where [...]?" Monica Gellar, who knew you would be such a cougar? We thought you were a clean freak that had no time to pick up after young men! The actress, best known for her role in Friends will forever be coined with the term cougar and she gives it a good name.</p><p><strong>Her first marriage to David Arquette, who was 7 years her junior, lasted 14 years until they got divorced and Cox was back in the jungle and on the prowl for her next mate.</strong></p><p>It did not take long before Cox found another companion younger than her, Johnny McDaid, who is a member of the band Snow Patrol and is 12 years younger than her. Hey, they look like a perfect match — or maybe that is just Cox's plastic surgery?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shakira-played-the-field-right><strong>Shakira Played The Field Right</strong></h2><p>This couple is so hot that no one should whisper a remark when it comes to the "Hips Don't Lie" singer and the Spanish soccer player. Male counterparts get away with dating women a decade younger than them without being labelled, and so should Shakira be allowed; have you seen what Gerard Piqué can do on that field? We cannot even decide which partner is luckier in this couple; Piqué might be the lucky one though since he plays for Barcelona and is married to the bombshell singer who could swing her hips in ways we cannot imagine.</p><p><strong>We say love knows no age, and that if we erased the age gap, we would tell no age difference between the two lovebirds.</strong></p><p>Shakira found her prince on a soccer field, and can we blame her for still gushing over him and their fairytale wedding?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cameron-diaz-loves-singers-who-are-younger><strong>Cameron Diaz Loves Singers Who Are Younger</strong></h2><p>Some of the hottest female celebrities are leading the way when it comes to dating younger men; and these stars are making it more commonplace for women to fall for younger men. Who would have thought that Cameron Diaz would dig rockers, and to top it off, younger men? The lucky man who snatched her up is Benji Madden, who was famous for being the leading man in the 2000s punk band Good Charlotte. She is 6 years older than him, and Madden must count his lucky stars every night; though she has cooled down in the spotlight, it is Cameron freaking Diaz.</p><p><strong>Diaz has dated younger men before, like Justin Timberlake, but we cannot dub her a total cougar as she has also dated men her age like Jared Leto.</strong></p><p>She has been around the block, but it is young men for the win for her!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-and-her-new-boy-toy><strong>Kourtney Kardashian And Her New Boy Toy</strong></h2><p>Times are changing, and one family responsible for a lot of change in Hollywood the past couple of years is the Kardashians; which other family could get away with as much as they do? After her split with Scott Disick, Kourtney Kardashian went on the lurk, and it was not long before she found her new boy toy, a 24-year-old Algerian model, Younes Bendjima. Not that anyone could tell or even bother to care about their 14-year age gap since she is Kourtney Kardashian and he is 6 feet and 2 inches of hotness.</p><p><strong>Though Kourtney is the one sister who has always kept her "private" life a little more private, the TV reality star does not hold back from getting on her toes, showing off her new hottie and claiming her property.</strong></p><p>We do not blame her.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-could-get-any-man><strong>Jennifer Lopez Could Get Any Man</strong></h2><p>If there is one woman in the world who could get any man she wants, it is Jenny from the block; so why not go for a younger and hipper man, right? Since J.Lo is always on the go, she needs a younger man who could keep up. Though she has not given love a bad name, she has definitely given the label cougar a good one. J.Lo has been dubbed with that infamous term since her divorce with Mark Anthony, because she scored two younger sizzling hot men. Though she has since only dated younger guys, she has continuously claimed that she is not after younger guys and that it is the younger guys who like her; J.Lo, all guys like you. After dating Casper Smart who was in his 20s, and then taking a crack at Drake who is in his 30s, she has now settled down with sportsman Alex Rodriguez, who is 6 years younger than the 48-year-old bootylicious singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julianne-moore-found-her-younger-hubby-on-set><strong>Julianne Moore Found Her Younger Hubby On Set</strong></h2><p>Sometimes they say that when you do not look for love, it comes to you when least expect it, and that is what happened to actress Julianne Moore. The spunky redhead, who is a fan favorite, keeps her private life very secretive, and most do not know that her husband, and father of her children, is 9 years her junior. Her husband, Bart Freundlich, looks much older than her though (oops...was that said out loud?). After Moore's first divorce, she began filming almost instantly, not looking for love, or anything commitment wise and just focusing on her job. However, her now hubby swept her off of her feet almost instantly.</p><p><strong>When confronted about the age gap between the two, Moore confirmed that as their relationship progressed, the age difference ceased to make a difference or an issue between the two.</strong></p><p>Another successful marriage on this list thus far; maybe women should keep their eyes open on the decade under them!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cheryl-cole-found-love-in-one-direction><strong>Cheryl Cole Found Love In One Direction</strong></h2><p>Who knew that auditioning for a show could also lead to finding love? The British pop star was coined an uncaged cougar after she set her eyes on 1D member Liam Payne, who auditioned for X Factor when she had a stint as a judge. This is, however, not the first time Cole dated a man much younger than she, hence being dubbed an uncaged cougar. Hey, a woman has got to do what a woman has got to do!</p><p><strong>Cole first met her now husband on the reality competition show when the singer was only 15.</strong></p><p>The pair, who are 10 years apart, only made their romance public together in 2016, when they hit the red-carpet hand in hand. They are both constantly seen gushing over each other, and recently, they welcomed their first child together. Sigh!</p><h2 id=sam-taylor-wood-and-her-much-younger-beau><strong>Sam Taylor-Wood And Her Much Younger Beau</strong></h2><p>If any young man wants to get himself a spunky and experienced older woman, then who better to go for then the director of the film Fifty Shades of Grey. The A-list British director Sam Taylor-Wood, is married to Aaron Taylor Johnson, despite being more than twice his age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>With an age gap of 24 years, the two met on set when Aaron was cast to be in her film Nowhere Boy — the boy definitely did get somewhere, though.</strong></p><p>With all her "experience", we are sure that Aaron did not hold back or think twice when starting a romantic relationship with the 51-year-old. The director and kickass actor tied the knot in 2012, and Aaron insisted they start a family together and they now have two children. According to Aaron, his wife brought him down to Earth — aw, young love!</p><h2 id=mother-kardashian-and-her-younger-boyfriend><strong>Mother Kardashian And Her Younger Boyfriend</strong></h2><p>Which other momma besides Kardashian clan mother, Kris Jenner, could land a hot and young billionaire? Though it has been a four year on and off relationship, Jenner has been dating Justin Bieber tour manager Corey Gamble without any shame or care for their 25-year age gap. Who could actually tell their age difference anyway? They are both loaded with money and can get away with just about anything, especially with their daily pampering.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Jenner is known as one of the greatest businesswoman in the world at the moment, and whether their romance is more of a business one or not, Kris Jenner is going to do what she wants anyway.</strong></p><p>The queen of throwing parties must love having her toy boy around as he keeps her refreshed and in shape. Rawr Mrs. Jenner!</p><h2 id=mary-kate-olsen-and-her-older-billionaire-husband><strong>Mary Kate Olsen And Her Older Billionaire Husband</strong></h2><p>When it comes to dating, what often shocks people the most is some couples age differences; that issue is a little less prevalent in Hollywood though. In the case of female celebrities, even some of the richest ones, they tend to gravitate towards older men, hot or not. Take one of the Olsen twins, Mary-Kate, who has been in the spotlight since a baby — who would have thought she would marry a man much older than she? Olsen, is married to French billionaire Olivier Sarkozy, who is 17 years her senior.</p><p><strong>When the wedding news first broke, many criticized the relationship, calling it a mismatch.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the odd married couple progressed though, they seemed more of a match with their weird ways; like having a very tiny wedding with cigarette centrepieces. Nobody can accuse the star for being in it for the money, because the twin has been extremely successful and rich in her own right.</p><h2 id=catherine-zeta-jones-loves-her-silver-man><strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones Loves Her Silver Man</strong></h2><p>This couple has always made people cringe, considering the fact that the stunning Catherine Zeta-Jones has looked like Michael Douglas' caretaker their entire marriage. It is not to say that silver haired man is not a fox, but next to the lavish Zeta-Jones, he does not look half as good.</p><p><strong>After 17 years of marriage, Douglas must be doing something right, and she must be happy with her decision to be with her older gent.</strong></p><p>This week, the couple were spotted on break in the Dominican Republic, and they both are clearly still very much in love. In Hollywood, for years, it has been cliché for older men to date much younger women, but this Hollywood power couple has put on display for 17 years the perks of their age difference — way to go guys!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-statham-got-himself-an-angel><strong>Jason Statham Got Himself An Angel</strong></h2><p>We do not blame this striking Victoria Secret model for being the darling of the on-screen tough man Jason Statham — and we would not want to mess with him and try to steal his girl either. They're one of Hollywood's most leading couples, but the couple who have been together since 2010 have managed to keep their steamy relationship out of the spotlight.</p><p><strong>The former Angel and her handsome man always look so effortlessly in love with one another when they are rarely captured in photographs.</strong></p><p>With a 20-year age gap, the model and her stuntman fiancé, welcomed their bundle of joy, baby boy Jack last year; with those genes, Jack is going to melt hearts. Though the couple are so fiercely private about their relationship, their secret to success is a mystery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blake-lively-and-her-older-man><strong>Blake Lively And Her "Older" Man</strong></h2><p>Though he is not a silver fox yet, Blake Lively most definitely got her hands on one of the hottest Hollywood A-listers in his 40s; Ryan Reynolds is getting a little bit grey, but that is beside the point. The leggy and blonde bombshell, when she was 25, landed Hollywood's hottest bachelor and married him — lucky him or lucky her? The power couple took the world by surprise when they decided to make the wedding bells chime in 2012 completely unexpectedly. Though they have a little more than a decade age gap, who could resist laying their hands on Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds? With an 11-year age difference, the pair make being in love look simple and crazy fun. And besides, who could tell that there is an 11-year difference between the two? They are the definition of relationship goals.</p><h2 id=ashley-olsen-loves-older-men-too><strong>Ashley Olsen Loves Older Men Too</strong></h2><p>After reading this, you want might want to question the Olsen twin’s eyesight or credibility. It is not to judge the men they are with and say they are horrendous, but the twins were literally the cutest babies, then the prettiest teenagers, and then the most beautiful adults, why would they not go for men more of their caliber? Ashley Olsen, did not fall far from her sister's path; they must both have a thing for older men, they are twins after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Ashley Olsen, not long after her sister got married, started dating 58-year-old art-dealer Richard Sachs, a man 28 years her senior.</strong></p><p>The two were spotted on a double date with Mary-Kate and her older husband, and that was when Ashley confirmed the rumors of their relationship.</p><h2 id=calista-flockhart-has-her-very-own-han-solo><strong>Calista Flockhart Has Her Very Own Han Solo</strong></h2><p>If a man wants to learn how to be a real man, they should call up Harrison Ford; this man has all the spunk and attributes a gentleman should have. And so, we do not blame Calista Flockhart, who is most known for her past role in the comedy-drama television series Ally McBeal, for not being able to resist Han Solo in real life. Despite the 22-year age gap between the puppy lovers, there has been nothing but positive spotlight on them.</p><p><strong>Their romantic love clearly proves that age is just number. Her endless love for him shone through when she was endearingly by his side after Ford's near-fatal plane crash.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They also took their time and dated for 8 years before signing the paper saying their "I dos." When they wed, handsome Ford was 67 while Flockhart was 45. Evidently, the age difference is unimportant to the spouses.</p><h2 id=amber-tamblyn-found-love-in-a-comedian><strong>Amber Tamblyn Found Love In A Comedian</strong></h2><p>Some people are just meant to be together, even despite the two-decade age difference. Many do not know that comedian David Cross is married and shares a child with the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants star Amber Tamblyn, who stole our hearts in that film. The comedian must have stolen her heart though, because despite their 19-year age difference, Tamblyn made sure she got what she wanted after the first time meeting him.</p><p><strong>The two first met at a show in NYC and then crossed paths again during a flight in Houston where the star laid eyes on him and decided to switch seats on the plane to get closer to him.</strong></p><p>And that was their happily ever after. Though Cross does look much older than she, the two have personalities that go in perfect harmony.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amal-clooney-and-the-top-silver-fox><strong>Amal Clooney And The Top Silver Fox</strong></h2><p>Though not a celebrity until she snatched up the silver fox of all silver foxes, George Clooney, Amal, a lawyer, first met the Hollywood charmer in 2013 at a charity fundraiser and the pair immediately hit it off. Who knew that it would take a lawyer to finally tie Clooney down?</p><p><strong>It did not take long for the power couple to decide that they were meant to be, despite the 17-year age gap.</strong></p><p>Their fairytale wedding took place only one year later from when they first met, and it was nothing short of posh and lavish. Even though the grey-haired hunk, who was voted the top silver fox, has been snapped up by beautiful Amal, it does not mean we can't stare. Sometimes, love really does come to those who wait.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-hemming-and-her-biggest-fan><strong>Emma Hemming And Her&nbsp;Biggest Fan</strong></h2><p>She may not be as popular as her other half in Hollywood, but Emma Hemming, has been referred to as Mrs. Willis since 2009. It did not work the first time around for the Die Hard heavyweight actor, who was first married to Demi Moore, so Willis found himself a much younger hottie that he cannot seem to live without. The action hero and model, have an age difference of over 20 years, but they both share a die-hard love for each other (pun intended).</p><p><strong>The two do not shy away from cameras when they are together, and Hemming always puts on display the extreme love she has for her darling silver fox.</strong></p><p>And this, ladies and gentleman, comes to prove that age is just a number and love is the answer.</p><h2 id=camila-alves-won-matthew-mcconaughey-s-heart><strong>Camila Alves Won Matthew McConaughey’s Heart</strong></h2><p>Who would make Matthew McConaughey work for it? The Brazilian/American model and designer Camila Alves did. Alright, alright, alright, who can say no to McConaughey? The A-list actor, who dated many famous women before meeting Alves, was not looking for love when he incidentally met Alves. However, though he obviously fell in love at first sight with the beautiful olive-skinned model, Alves, had actually rejected him at the start of their relationship in 2006.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>And happily ever after, 6 years later, Matthew McConaughey tied the knot with longtime love Camila Alves in June 2012, despite their 14-year-age gap that many do not know about.</strong></p><p>However, this age difference did not stop the couple from welcoming three lovely children into the world.
